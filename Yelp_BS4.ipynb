Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\n\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\n\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\n\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\n\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\n\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn't. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\n\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\n\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it's not overly sweet, it's definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\", \"author\": \"Gill S.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2020-01-01\", \"description\": \"Good food every time I've gone.

Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\n\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\"would eat again\\\" to \\\"skip it\\\": \\n\\n*Nick's Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\n\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it's perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\n\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\n\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\n\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don't know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that's what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\n\\n*Charcuterie - it's build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don't sleep on pickled shrimp. I've never had anything like it \\u0026 I love the corn butter that it's served with. \\n\\nLastly, I can't believe I'm saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\n\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\n\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\", \"author\": \"Tiffany H.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2020-02-07\", \"description\": \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end.

The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\n\\nWe had the chef's special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I'm so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I've had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I'm writing this almost a week after I went, that's the problem here.

Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented.

It's dark but not too dark, and there's background music that doesn't overwhelm -- so it's a great place for a date.\\n\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can't go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\n\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\u0026 cooked.\\n\\nThe service, while friendly \\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would've expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\", \"author\": \"Arturo F.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2019-10-10\", \"description\": \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\n\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we're slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\n\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it's perfectly don't here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we'll share the baos next time instead.\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\n\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\n\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don't spend that lightly, so that's how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\n\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\n\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I'm a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\"Mara's Meatloaf\\\", (it's covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I'm not sure I've ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they're amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they're packed and you don't have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\", \"author\": \"Dawn V.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2019-08-05\", \"description\": \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\n\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what's fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\n\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\n\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\n\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\n\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\n\\nTIP: If you're interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones).

As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible.

Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\"butcher shop\\\" all in one. \\n\\nAbout the food:\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\"Snacks\\\"\\nA few speciality cocktails\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\n\\nService:\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\n\\nPlace:\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\"butcher counter\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\n\\nOther observations:\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot.

That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn't have any basis for that hope.\\n\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\n\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn't get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\n\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\n\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\n\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn't expect any restaurant to make everyone happy.

This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\n\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it's a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it's so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won't be disappointed. \\n\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients.

Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn't packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I've ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn't care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent.

The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish.

Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We eat all over Detroit and it\\'s a favorite here now.\"', ' \"This is my fourth experience at Marrow. Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar. Everything was top notch!\\\\n\\\\nTo go I got a package of dry aged burgers (which we threw on the grill last night and OMG SO GOOD) a frozen meatloaf (probably my least favorite thing I purchased. It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience. And you know I\\'ll be back for all those market purchases again, too!\"', ' \"Off the beaten path, in a residential area. Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene. I cannot wait to spread the word about this place and come back often to try even more items on their beautifully crafted menu. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL MEAL AND EXPERIENCE, MARROW!\"', ' \"5  for cool venue,happy to see some rejoovenation in this area! The food was amazing. Gets 4 stars based on prices. Elevated, in my opinion. When the area (parking) is a bit cleaned up more then it could be a solid 5.\"', ' \"Marrow may have the best food in Detroit right now. Every dish was executed so well! The service and vibe are perfect. Everything from snacks to dessert was truly delicious. We\\'ll be back for sure.\"', ' \"This was one of 2 must-visit places that our daughter had identified for our first trip to see her in Detroit (just FYI, the other was Selden Standard).  She chose well.  \\\\nThere were three of us, and we shared 5 menu items among us, making for a very satisfying dinner.  We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.  Overall a nice dining experience.  Would try it again, but probably would do the regular menu and be less hungry next time.\"', ' \"New \\\\u0026 Yummy!\\\\nMy friend recommended this place, and she did not disappoint (and neither did Marrow).\\\\nStarter - chorizo dumplings. Chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a bit of cheese - served with sour cream, hot sauce, and corn for dipping/addition.\\\\nSeasonal donut - made in house, crispy outside with a fall apart soft inside. The tiny candied oranges on top really brought this to a 4 star rating. It was a cinnamon sugar donut over a layer of caramel spread.\\\\nMy friend adored her lamb scrambled egg bowl, with the home made English muffin.\\\\nCappuccinos are strong \\\\u0026 the fresh squeezed juice is a bit pricey, but tastes fresh and delish.\\\\nOverall, a happy choice for brunch.\\\\nForewarning - they will not sit you until 10AM, but you can sit at the bar and order a drink while you wait.\"', ' \"Came for brunch and the food here is delicious. We got a Jian bing, Congee and tallow potatoes. Potatoes were bomb, get them. Jian bing was decent--if you like pickles, pickled raddish and pickled cabbage (pickled veggies in general) you\\'ll probably enjoy this. I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies. Overall it was good and we\\'ll probably come back for dinner.\"', ' \"Since I heard about this opening, I really wanted to come. I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"']\n",

The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We eat all over Detroit and it\\'s a favorite here now.\"', ' \"This is my fourth experience at Marrow. Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar.

It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience. And you know I\\'ll be back for all those market purchases again, too!\"', ' \"Off the beaten path, in a residential area. Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene. I cannot wait to spread the word about this place and come back often to try even more items on their beautifully crafted menu. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL MEAL AND EXPERIENCE, MARROW!\"', ' \"5  for cool venue,happy to see some rejoovenation in this area! The food was amazing. Gets 4 stars based on prices. Elevated, in my opinion. When the area (parking) is a bit cleaned up more then it could be a solid 5.\"', ' \"Marrow may have the best food in Detroit right now. Every dish was executed so well!

She chose well.  \\\\nThere were three of us, and we shared 5 menu items among us, making for a very satisfying dinner.  We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.  Overall a nice dining experience.  Would try it again, but probably would do the regular menu and be less hungry next time.\"', ' \"New \\\\u0026 Yummy!\\\\nMy friend recommended this place, and she did not disappoint (and neither did Marrow).\\\\nStarter - chorizo dumplings. Chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a bit of cheese - served with sour cream, hot sauce, and corn for dipping/addition.\\\\nSeasonal donut - made in house, crispy outside with a fall apart soft inside. The tiny candied oranges on top really brought this to a 4 star rating. It was a cinnamon sugar donut over a layer of caramel spread.\\\\nMy friend adored her lamb scrambled egg bowl, with the home made English muffin.\\\\nCappuccinos are strong \\\\u0026 the fresh squeezed juice is a bit pricey, but tastes fresh and delish.\\\\nOverall, a happy choice for brunch.\\\\nForewarning - they will not sit you until 10AM, but you can sit at the bar and order a drink while you wait.\"', ' \"Came for brunch and the food here is delicious. We got a Jian bing, Congee and tallow potatoes. Potatoes were bomb, get them. Jian bing was decent--if you like pickles, pickled raddish and pickled cabbage (pickled veggies in general) you\\'ll probably enjoy this. I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies. Overall it was good and we\\'ll probably come back for dinner.\"', ' \"Since I heard about this opening, I really wanted to come. I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"']\n",

I think the butcher's shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef's selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\n\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety.

We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow's menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size.

It's hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical).

I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn't one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I'm very understanding, but I think one of them could've been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There's a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there's the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\n\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef's tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\n\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I'm familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn't bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they're used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn't have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I'm not knocking down the dumpling at all--it's good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\"this is venison?!\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef's selection is worth it! You won't regret it, and I think it's at a great price point of $50.\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\nThe fried squash with dates wasn't my favorite only because I really don't like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I'm glad I tried it. \\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\nThanks for hanging in there, I'm almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn't part of the chef's menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn't get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don't miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\n\\nOverall, more hits than misses.

The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

(Really though, have a LOT of dietary restrictions (I follow a Low FODMAP diet, which is gluten free, dairy free, and much more), and my dietary restrictions are never a barrier to the preparation of a delicious meal).

It\\'s a bit hard to review this one, I would actually give it a 3.5, but I\\'m rounded up as that is not an option. \\\\n\\\\nMy two friends and I were not able to make reservations, so we took the risk, and went a little early. We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings. They were terrible enough to send back, something I very early do. We also had a couple salads, both were great, fresh and nice sizes. For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd. The noodles and curry were both meal sizes, the scallops were very light.

They explained the upcharge cost was in fact a mistake and that it truly should have been just a slight up charge. They suggested many ways to try and make it right on their part.

I can\\'t wait to come back and try Marrow again! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis place was delicious! I had never heard of it, but my boyfriend surprised me with reservations. I highly encourage making a reservation before coming. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat in the dining room and got the family style tasting menu. This was amazing. There were a few things that the chef made us that weren\\'t even on the menu! Two of my favorites were the dumplings and the meatballs. The portions looked small, but man did they add up! I walked out feeling satisfied and full. \\\\nMy only negative about this (and honestly it reflects on the waiter) is that we upgraded to beef instead of pork. Our waiter said it was a slight up-charge, but when we received the bill it was a $50 up charge. To me that is not slight and the waiter should have absolutely said that\\'s how much it was!!! (Update: Marrow reached out and made this right as it was an error). \\\\n\\\\nAlthough this is a butcher shop, there meat selection did seem to be limited. I was expecting a few more meat selections on the menu, but even without that the menu sounded amazing!! \\\\n\\\\nThe owner was there and walking around a lot. She was very nice and did great job interacting with tables throughout the night. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter was ok. He wasn\\'t as attentive as most other wait staff I saw at their tables. He came up a few times to check on us, but most other wait staff seemed to check on their tables a lot.\"', ' \"We loved Marrow! You walk in through the Butcher Shop, which not only has a meat counter and large pieces of meat dry-aging, but also a hip little bar with trendy cocktails where you can get a drink while you wait for your table. After our server walked us through the options on the menu, we opted for the family style chef\\'s selection plus wine pairing.  This turned out to be a great choice because we got to try a lot of different things and didn\\'t have to make any decisions.  Everything was so good, with larger portions than a traditional tasting menu, and well-paced. We did order an additional dish of the Roasted Marrow, because it wasn\\'t part of the Chef\\'s Selections, and come on, the place is called Marrow! We were glad we did, because it was delicious. It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical). We will definitely be back to Marrow- there are still so many delicious things on the menu left to try, plus there\\'s brunch!\"', ' \"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I\\'d do it.  The atmosphere is unparalleled with the butcher shop in the main room of the restaurant. Once we were seated in the dining room, our waiter was prompt in greeting us and telling us about the farm to table style the restaurant runs by. Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!  He also asked us about any allergies or food restrictions which is such a personalized touch, it made the entire thing feel like it was personalized for us. I wasn\\'t totally sure of some of the wine selections and he knew his stuff and how to pair to compliment our meals.  We went with our waiters recommendation to sample the menu with the 7 dishes they chose and brought out in a course style meal.

Not overly pricey we will definitely return.\"', ' \"Best Thing I Ever Ate: Kasekrainer Sausage\\\\n\\\\nI stopped in to give Marrow another try. This time I got the kasekrainer sausage and the Smoked Ham. The Kasekrainer is the best brautwust I\\'ve ever had.

I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive. I have literally dined all over the world. Last night Marrow situated a few blocks from a house my wife and I are renovating proved to be one of the top five meals I have ever had.

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now! Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\\\n\\\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience.

Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience.

It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible.

Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene.

We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.

I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies. Overall it was good and we\\'ll probably come back for dinner.\"', ' \"Since I heard about this opening, I really wanted to come. I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

(Really though, have a LOT of dietary restrictions (I follow a Low FODMAP diet, which is gluten free, dairy free, and much more), and my dietary restrictions are never a barrier to the preparation of a delicious meal). The design, set up and decor of the restaurant are straight out of West Elm (in all of the right ways)--makes you want to keep ordering snacks, drinks, and good times!\"', ' \"We came here and had the most wonderful experience we could ever think of. Menu is awesome staff great. So glad  we went and  we will definitely be back so much more to try lol\"', ' \"Marrow is one of the restaurants on the best of 2019 new restaurants. It\\'s a bit hard to review this one, I would actually give it a 3.5, but I\\'m rounded up as that is not an option. \\\\n\\\\nMy two friends and I were not able to make reservations, so we took the risk, and went a little early. We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings. They were terrible enough to send back, something I very early do. We also had a couple salads, both were great, fresh and nice sizes. For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd. The noodles and curry were both meal sizes, the scallops were very light. The menu seems to change frequently, so the items I mentioned may or may not still be on the menu (check the website if you are picky).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a good experience but I\\'m not sure I\\'d go back.\"', ' \"Update: \\\\nThe response I received from Marrow was amazing. They explained the upcharge cost was in fact a mistake and that it truly should have been just a slight up charge. They suggested many ways to try and make it right on their part. If this doesn\\'t speak to the character of this restaurant I don\\'t what does. Thank you for doing what you can to make things right! I can\\'t wait to come back and try Marrow again! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis place was delicious! I had never heard of it, but my boyfriend surprised me with reservations. I highly encourage making a reservation before coming. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat in the dining room and got the family style tasting menu. This was amazing. There were a few things that the chef made us that weren\\'t even on the menu! Two of my favorites were the dumplings and the meatballs. The portions looked small, but man did they add up! I walked out feeling satisfied and full. \\\\nMy only negative about this (and honestly it reflects on the waiter) is that we upgraded to beef instead of pork. Our waiter said it was a slight up-charge, but when we received the bill it was a $50 up charge. To me that is not slight and the waiter should have absolutely said that\\'s how much it was!!! (Update: Marrow reached out and made this right as it was an error). \\\\n\\\\nAlthough this is a butcher shop, there meat selection did seem to be limited. I was expecting a few more meat selections on the menu, but even without that the menu sounded amazing!! \\\\n\\\\nThe owner was there and walking around a lot. She was very nice and did great job interacting with tables throughout the night. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter was ok. He wasn\\'t as attentive as most other wait staff I saw at their tables. He came up a few times to check on us, but most other wait staff seemed to check on their tables a lot.\"', ' \"We loved Marrow! You walk in through the Butcher Shop, which not only has a meat counter and large pieces of meat dry-aging, but also a hip little bar with trendy cocktails where you can get a drink while you wait for your table. After our server walked us through the options on the menu, we opted for the family style chef\\'s selection plus wine pairing.  This turned out to be a great choice because we got to try a lot of different things and didn\\'t have to make any decisions.  Everything was so good, with larger portions than a traditional tasting menu, and well-paced. We did order an additional dish of the Roasted Marrow, because it wasn\\'t part of the Chef\\'s Selections, and come on, the place is called Marrow! We were glad we did, because it was delicious. It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical). We will definitely be back to Marrow- there are still so many delicious things on the menu left to try, plus there\\'s brunch!\"', ' \"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I\\'d do it.  The atmosphere is unparalleled with the butcher shop in the main room of the restaurant. Once we were seated in the dining room, our waiter was prompt in greeting us and telling us about the farm to table style the restaurant runs by. Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!  He also asked us about any allergies or food restrictions which is such a personalized touch, it made the entire thing feel like it was personalized for us. I wasn\\'t totally sure of some of the wine selections and he knew his stuff and how to pair to compliment our meals.  We went with our waiters recommendation to sample the menu with the 7 dishes they chose and brought out in a course style meal. They also brought my husband a surprise dessert for his birthday that was completely comped.  If you\\'re looking for a meal that has amazingly fresh, complex and layered flavors with unique spins on traditional dishes, run-- don\\'t walk, to Marrow!!\\\\n\\\\nMust order: \\\\nCharcuterie (pick what you please)\\\\nGlutinous Rice Dumplings \\\\nSeasonal Yaki (ours was scallops)\\\\nCharred Vegetable Salad \\\\n\\\\nTruthfully, based on everyone\\'s meals around us, nothing looked like it could go wrong!!!!\"', ' \"A group of us made a reservation and went to Marrow for brunch and it was delicious. We started with the donuts and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was delicious, and I highly recommend it. \\\\nFor lunch we all ordered different things. The rest of the table had the coconut grains, steak \\\\u0026 sunny duck egg, shrimp \\\\u0026 \\\\\"grits\\\\\", and the lamb scramble. Everyone enjoyed their dish. \\\\nI ordered the Scallion Pancakes w/ Duck Egg. The egg was perfect and runny. I loved it. \\\\nOverall I enjoyed the food and the staff was great. Bonus there is a lot to park in, which was convenient.\"', ' \"I\\'ve had three amazing experiences at Marrow, trying a variety of foods. Some of my favorites are the pork skin popcorn, dumplings, marrow itself and scallops. Services staff and kitchen put the guest experience first. On my second visit, when the brunch dumplings were sold out, they ended up making dinner dumplings for the table, which was very appreciated. Cocktail list is always on point and you can typically get a reservation, which is a plus.\"', ' \"One the better restaurants around. Went because of some reviews and must say we were very pleased!\\\\nA lot of interesting things on the menu some things I probably would not order. We decide to do the Chef selections and couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\\\nGot a selection of six plates and did an upgrade to try the bone marrow. Noticed some people came in had a plate or two and a cocktail or wine. Had an excellent Rose from Corsica recommend by our server. Not overly pricey we will definitely return.\"', ' \"Best Thing I Ever Ate: Kasekrainer Sausage\\\\n\\\\nI stopped in to give Marrow another try. This time I got the kasekrainer sausage and the Smoked Ham. The Kasekrainer is the best brautwust I\\'ve ever had. The meat had a complex smoky flavor, indicating the use of more than one type of wood. There was a slight bit of spice, giving a pleasant peppery bite. Even better, the sausages were filled with butterkase cheese. \\\\n\\\\nThe Smoked Ham was delightful - Perfectly smoked with a sweet meaty flavor. It made a wonderful croque monsieur sandwich. I would definitely order more than next time I stop by.\"', ' \"The meal I had here last Thursday was one of the best meals of my life. The server was excellent. The bartender was so thoughtful and helpful it was just great. But the meal - the meal! - we ordered all the entrees and shared and they were all - the steak, the lamb, the pork shoulder - beyond delicious. We all left agreeing that it was one of the nicest dinners we had experienced in a long, long time.\"', ' \"What a breath of fresh air in Grosse Pointe. The ambience is new, hip and embraces hipster culture. \\\\nMy husband and I ordered the special which allows you to have samples from different meats and cheeses. I believe it was called the chef\\'s special.  The lamb had to be my favorite because it was cooked perfectly and paired with an amazing sweet jelly. Located conveniently next door is a butcher where you can purchase everything you just ate. I highly recommend this place for date night or for cocktails after work with friends.\"', ' \"Customer service is lacking. I called and specifically asked for an item, I was told they always carry it and didn\\'t need a special order. When I went there to pick it up days later , they didn\\'t have it. Very disappointed. Dry age case looks good though. \\\\n\\\\nWent in for the tasting menu, the dishes were excellent, full of flavor and well put. The server was great too.\"', ' \"My husband and I enjoyed a lovely dinner here tonight.\\\\nI ordered the mull drink or something... it was a little to strong for my liking...\\\\nFor starters we ordered\\\\nBone marrow\\\\nBeef tartar\\\\nBrussel sprout\\\\nThe Brussel sprouts were out of this world incredible! \\\\nWe both ordered the steak, it was amazing!\\\\nOverall, we loved it \\\\u0026 will be back!\"', ' \"Exceeded the hype. Dinner tasting menu was outstanding and a relative bargain at only $50. (I\\'m used to NYC prices and this was way more food than we could eat.) \\\\n\\\\nWe were ticked off at first because the three of us were put at the bar, after having made reservations a month in advance. But all was forgiven once we experienced the food! \\\\n\\\\nRibeye was well worth the upsell. Silky scallops and fluffy meatballs were our favorites! Also loved the terrine. Was almost too full for main course when it arrived!\"', ' \"Great concept. They buy a cow, butcher it inside the restaurant when closed (yes, actually in the dining room), age the meat, then either sell it from the butcher shop or serve it in the restaurant.  Located in an area of town that is still in a transition stage, it took a brave entrepreneur to do this project. And the reward was a James Beard nomination for best new restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance: Very comfortable, bistro-like, trendy, but understated. Great design and build out.\\\\n\\\\nWine list: Owner also owns a wine bar in Detroit so knows her stuff. Too bad her palate and my palate are polar opposites.  Not much on the wine list I like. Wish she would diversify. \\\\n\\\\nService: All trained professional servers, but not over-the-top. Our server was a bit slow and kept disappearing, but it did take away from the experience. \\\\n\\\\nMenu: surprisingly, not very meat-centric.  About half the entr\\\\u00e9es are vegetarian.  Creative and diverse. Charcuterie changes regularly. Prices seem to be extremely reasonable.  \\\\n\\\\nFood: all solid, but with one exception, none of it was like \\\\\"oh my gosh, this is delicious!\\\\\". The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.  Curious to try their steak next time.I\"', ' \"I have been spreading the word about this spot in West Village since I dined here.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a butcher shop restaurant combo located on Kercheval Ave. They have a small parking lot off the side of the building, but also unpaid street parking is available.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is small, so I would highly suggest calling ahead if you have a big group to see if they will make accommodations. \\\\n\\\\nGreat menu selection, with dishes that seemed Asian inspired, I loved everything we ordered. The tartare was great(you\\'ll notice it isn\\'t served with the typical quail egg) except I prefer when they serve the dish with toasted baguette slices opposed to kettle like chips. Loved the cauliflower with the feta and yellow raisins. Also honorable mention: the radish slaw.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I went with the Dry Aged Chef\\'s choice. It was awesome. A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive. I have literally dined all over the world. Last night Marrow situated a few blocks from a house my wife and I are renovating proved to be one of the top five meals I have ever had.

This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn't as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn't love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I'd eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn't need one. It wasn't crowded at all at that hour.)

Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit's West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\n\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow's dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\"popcorn,\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\n\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage.

      " [' \"The newest culinary jewel to West Village, Detroit. Their current brunch menu features several small plates, each very tasteful. A finer spin on a traditional Asian bao, American slider, and middle eastern kabob. Marrow holds at the heart of (most of) their dishes a quality protein. Though what shines in the overall palette are their complex sauces/glazes. Alongside a delicious cocktail.\\\\n\\\\nOverall: 4/5 a beautiful new spot in a great Detroit neighborhood. Their lamb kabobs were delicious. Enjoy!\"', ' \"My wife gifted me a sausage making workshop at Marrow. Ping, the owner welcomed us, and her two excellent butchers (Eric \\\\u0026 Chris, I think?) did an outstanding job explaining the process of sausage making from balancing ingredients \\\\u0026 the purpose of salt, to prep to process including coarse vs fine grinding and the actual casing of the meat. We made sweet Italian \\\\u0026 brats.\\\\nThey served us samples of some of their other sausages - each was different \\\\u0026 delicious. At the end of the evening, we each had a take-home bag with several of the 2 sausages we made that night.\\\\nThey emphasize local/Michigan \\\\u0026 all-natural products, do their own butchering, aging and smoking, all in a spotless environment in burgeoning Indian Village. Can\\'t wait to go back and check out the restaurant side of this great spot!\"', ' \"My brother and I visited Detroit for a weekend, and we picked Marrow for our last meal in the city! This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn\\'t need one. It wasn\\'t crowded at all at that hour.) Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage. Diners of today are more invested than ever in animal welfare and local farms -- it\\'s a pleasure to support a business that extends the same concern to its people. | MarrowDetroit.com\\\\n\\\\n-- Brenna Houck, Eater Detroit editor\"', ' \"Prawns in the seasonal yakatori were slimy - after they told me \\\\\"the chef wasn\\'t happy with the quality of the seafood, so they\\'re making you another plate and it will be out shortly\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nMy husband ordered the local beef medium rare ($50) which came out rare, at best, and was full of gristle. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t go here.\\\\n\\\\n7/14 update - We are not looking for a free meal and won\\'t be back. The server clearly stated \\\\\"quality.\\\\\" Even if the \\\\\"cook\\\\\" was the actual cause for the delay, the prawns were still slimy and undesirable.

It\\'s nothing short of phenomenal.  \\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s a definite Asian influence in the various dishes that makes things interesting and unexpected.

Right by Indian Village in Detroit, this felt a bit off the beaten path and then I realized Craft Work is just a few blocks away and this is a block over from Sister Pie. Almost a hidden gem. \\\\nAs I age, I\\'m becoming hesitant at times to try new places since I\\'m nowhere near hipster. I appreciated that the clientele varied and we were by no means the oldest. \\\\nIf you are a picky eater, or have limitations with your diet, they\\'re wonderfully accommodating. I have a gluten sensitivity but try to not be high maintenance about it. They came up with a solution for everything. \\\\nOur waitress (Quinn) was absolutely fantastic. Thorough in describing the menu and gave us great recommendations. \\\\nWe did start with charcuterie, which is always a personal fave for me. We also had the burrata, which was a little bit of a stretch for us because neither of us care for tomatoes. It was delicious and we even went outside our comfort zones and ate some of the tomatoes. :)\\\\nThe beef choice that evening was an aged New York strip, which my husband chose, while I had one of the pork selections for the evening. I will never be able to accurately remember what came with each but it was unique, flavorful and fun. \\\\nAs if we needed it, we did do two desserts. I can only remember the name of one (ice cream sundae with fun flavors; not your standard) but the second was just scrumptious. It had whipped cream, chocolate ganache and cherries. Enough said. \\\\nOf course we had beer and wine - and their list for either is varied. Love how many local names appear throughout the menu. \\\\nGreat experience overall.\"', ' \"The customer service here is phenomenal! The rillette was beautifully done, and the marrow was so delicate and delicious.\"', ' \"Wonderful butcher shop in West Village that serves dinner every night except Tuesdays.\"', ' \"Marrow is a welcome addition to the current business revitalization of West Village.

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now!

Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful.

I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience.

Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented.

This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.

Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar.

It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience.

Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene.

For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.

I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting.

I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings.

For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd.

It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical).

Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!

They buy a cow, butcher it inside the restaurant when closed (yes, actually in the dining room), age the meat, then either sell it from the butcher shop or serve it in the restaurant.  Located in an area of town that is still in a transition stage, it took a brave entrepreneur to do this project. And the reward was a James Beard nomination for best new restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance: Very comfortable, bistro-like, trendy, but understated. Great design and build out.\\\\n\\\\nWine list: Owner also owns a wine bar in Detroit so knows her stuff. Too bad her palate and my palate are polar opposites.  Not much on the wine list I like. Wish she would diversify. \\\\n\\\\nService: All trained professional servers, but not over-the-top. Our server was a bit slow and kept disappearing, but it did take away from the experience. \\\\n\\\\nMenu: surprisingly, not very meat-centric.  About half the entr\\\\u00e9es are vegetarian.  Creative and diverse. Charcuterie changes regularly. Prices seem to be extremely reasonable.  \\\\n\\\\nFood: all solid, but with one exception, none of it was like \\\\\"oh my gosh, this is delicious!\\\\\". The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.  Curious to try their steak next time.I\"', ' \"I have been spreading the word about this spot in West Village since I dined here.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a butcher shop restaurant combo located on Kercheval Ave. They have a small parking lot off the side of the building, but also unpaid street parking is available.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is small, so I would highly suggest calling ahead if you have a big group to see if they will make accommodations. \\\\n\\\\nGreat menu selection, with dishes that seemed Asian inspired, I loved everything we ordered. The tartare was great(you\\'ll notice it isn\\'t served with the typical quail egg) except I prefer when they serve the dish with toasted baguette slices opposed to kettle like chips. Loved the cauliflower with the feta and yellow raisins. Also honorable mention: the radish slaw.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I went with the Dry Aged Chef\\'s choice. It was awesome. A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive. I have literally dined all over the world. Last night Marrow situated a few blocks from a house my wife and I are renovating proved to be one of the top five meals I have ever had. We opted for a 9 course tasting menu that was simply Devine. Each dish surpassed the last. This is simply an unexpected treat.\"', ' \"The newest culinary jewel to West Village, Detroit. Their current brunch menu features several small plates, each very tasteful. A finer spin on a traditional Asian bao, American slider, and middle eastern kabob. Marrow holds at the heart of (most of) their dishes a quality protein. Though what shines in the overall palette are their complex sauces/glazes. Alongside a delicious cocktail.\\\\n\\\\nOverall: 4/5 a beautiful new spot in a great Detroit neighborhood. Their lamb kabobs were delicious. Enjoy!\"', ' \"My wife gifted me a sausage making workshop at Marrow. Ping, the owner welcomed us, and her two excellent butchers (Eric \\\\u0026 Chris, I think?) did an outstanding job explaining the process of sausage making from balancing ingredients \\\\u0026 the purpose of salt, to prep to process including coarse vs fine grinding and the actual casing of the meat. We made sweet Italian \\\\u0026 brats.\\\\nThey served us samples of some of their other sausages - each was different \\\\u0026 delicious. At the end of the evening, we each had a take-home bag with several of the 2 sausages we made that night.\\\\nThey emphasize local/Michigan \\\\u0026 all-natural products, do their own butchering, aging and smoking, all in a spotless environment in burgeoning Indian Village. Can\\'t wait to go back and check out the restaurant side of this great spot!\"', ' \"My brother and I visited Detroit for a weekend, and we picked Marrow for our last meal in the city! This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn\\'t need one. It wasn\\'t crowded at all at that hour.) Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage. Diners of today are more invested than ever in animal welfare and local farms -- it\\'s a pleasure to support a business that extends the same concern to its people. | MarrowDetroit.com\\\\n\\\\n-- Brenna Houck, Eater Detroit editor\"', ' \"Prawns in the seasonal yakatori were slimy - after they told me \\\\\"the chef wasn\\'t happy with the quality of the seafood, so they\\'re making you another plate and it will be out shortly\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nMy husband ordered the local beef medium rare ($50) which came out rare, at best, and was full of gristle. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t go here.\\\\n\\\\n7/14 update - We are not looking for a free meal and won\\'t be back.

Right by Indian Village in Detroit, this felt a bit off the beaten path and then I realized Craft Work is just a few blocks away and this is a block over from Sister Pie. Almost a hidden gem. \\\\nAs I age, I\\'m becoming hesitant at times to try new places since I\\'m nowhere near hipster. I appreciated that the clientele varied and we were by no means the oldest. \\\\nIf you are a picky eater, or have limitations with your diet, they\\'re wonderfully accommodating. I have a gluten sensitivity but try to not be high maintenance about it. They came up with a solution for everything. \\\\nOur waitress (Quinn) was absolutely fantastic. Thorough in describing the menu and gave us great recommendations. \\\\nWe did start with charcuterie, which is always a personal fave for me. We also had the burrata, which was a little bit of a stretch for us because neither of us care for tomatoes. It was delicious and we even went outside our comfort zones and ate some of the tomatoes. :)\\\\nThe beef choice that evening was an aged New York strip, which my husband chose, while I had one of the pork selections for the evening. I will never be able to accurately remember what came with each but it was unique, flavorful and fun. \\\\nAs if we needed it, we did do two desserts. I can only remember the name of one (ice cream sundae with fun flavors; not your standard) but the second was just scrumptious. It had whipped cream, chocolate ganache and cherries. Enough said. \\\\nOf course we had beer and wine - and their list for either is varied.

First of all it's not a super large establishment it's actually what I would classify as the right size for premium service. Upon arriving at Morrow they were quite busy but not too busy for one of the three greeters at the door to greet me with a smile and ask how many would be with our party. They did say there's two open seats at the bar but hold on let me see if we can get you at the chef's table. Sure Nuff next thing you know I'm seated at the chef's table looking at a menu that is totally amazing. Where do you start well Robert was there to help make some of the decisions we started with the Glutinous Rice Dumplings with meat filling and local roe upon arrival they looked amazing but the taste was truly incredible after taking the first bite your head and you're body kind of enters a different universe and then after you chew and absorb the flavors and the texture you return back to Earth and say wow I've got to do that again and guess what with 3 dumplings you get multiple shots at it.

Making sure the temperature was medium and it rested 20 minutes.  Looked good.  Couldn\\'t even chew it.  Never in my life have a ever tasted such a bland, tuff piece of meat!

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now! Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\\\n\\\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We eat all over Detroit and it\\'s a favorite here now.\"', ' \"This is my fourth experience at Marrow. Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar. Everything was top notch!\\\\n\\\\nTo go I got a package of dry aged burgers (which we threw on the grill last night and OMG SO GOOD) a frozen meatloaf (probably my least favorite thing I purchased. It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience. And you know I\\'ll be back for all those market purchases again, too!\"', ' \"Off the beaten path, in a residential area. Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene. I cannot wait to spread the word about this place and come back often to try even more items on their beautifully crafted menu.

She chose well.  \\\\nThere were three of us, and we shared 5 menu items among us, making for a very satisfying dinner.  We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.  Overall a nice dining experience.  Would try it again, but probably would do the regular menu and be less hungry next time.\"', ' \"New \\\\u0026 Yummy!\\\\nMy friend recommended this place, and she did not disappoint (and neither did Marrow).\\\\nStarter - chorizo dumplings. Chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a bit of cheese - served with sour cream, hot sauce, and corn for dipping/addition.\\\\nSeasonal donut - made in house, crispy outside with a fall apart soft inside.

It was a cinnamon sugar donut over a layer of caramel spread.\\\\nMy friend adored her lamb scrambled egg bowl, with the home made English muffin.\\\\nCappuccinos are strong \\\\u0026 the fresh squeezed juice is a bit pricey, but tastes fresh and delish.\\\\nOverall, a happy choice for brunch.\\\\nForewarning - they will not sit you until 10AM, but you can sit at the bar and order a drink while you wait.\"', ' \"Came for brunch and the food here is delicious. We got a Jian bing, Congee and tallow potatoes. Potatoes were bomb, get them. Jian bing was decent--if you like pickles, pickled raddish and pickled cabbage (pickled veggies in general) you\\'ll probably enjoy this. I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies. Overall it was good and we\\'ll probably come back for dinner.\"', ' \"Since I heard about this opening, I really wanted to come. I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

(Really though, have a LOT of dietary restrictions (I follow a Low FODMAP diet, which is gluten free, dairy free, and much more), and my dietary restrictions are never a barrier to the preparation of a delicious meal).

It\\'s a bit hard to review this one, I would actually give it a 3.5, but I\\'m rounded up as that is not an option. \\\\n\\\\nMy two friends and I were not able to make reservations, so we took the risk, and went a little early. We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings. They were terrible enough to send back, something I very early do. We also had a couple salads, both were great, fresh and nice sizes. For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd. The noodles and curry were both meal sizes, the scallops were very light. The menu seems to change frequently, so the items I mentioned may or may not still be on the menu (check the website if you are picky).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a good experience but I\\'m not sure I\\'d go back.\"', ' \"Update: \\\\nThe response I received from Marrow was amazing. They explained the upcharge cost was in fact a mistake and that it truly should have been just a slight up charge. They suggested many ways to try and make it right on their part. If this doesn\\'t speak to the character of this restaurant I don\\'t what does. Thank you for doing what you can to make things right! I can\\'t wait to come back and try Marrow again! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis place was delicious! I had never heard of it, but my boyfriend surprised me with reservations. I highly encourage making a reservation before coming. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat in the dining room and got the family style tasting menu. This was amazing. There were a few things that the chef made us that weren\\'t even on the menu! Two of my favorites were the dumplings and the meatballs. The portions looked small, but man did they add up! I walked out feeling satisfied and full. \\\\nMy only negative about this (and honestly it reflects on the waiter) is that we upgraded to beef instead of pork. Our waiter said it was a slight up-charge, but when we received the bill it was a $50 up charge. To me that is not slight and the waiter should have absolutely said that\\'s how much it was!!! (Update: Marrow reached out and made this right as it was an error). \\\\n\\\\nAlthough this is a butcher shop, there meat selection did seem to be limited. I was expecting a few more meat selections on the menu, but even without that the menu sounded amazing!! \\\\n\\\\nThe owner was there and walking around a lot. She was very nice and did great job interacting with tables throughout the night. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter was ok. He wasn\\'t as attentive as most other wait staff I saw at their tables. He came up a few times to check on us, but most other wait staff seemed to check on their tables a lot.\"', ' \"We loved Marrow! You walk in through the Butcher Shop, which not only has a meat counter and large pieces of meat dry-aging, but also a hip little bar with trendy cocktails where you can get a drink while you wait for your table. After our server walked us through the options on the menu, we opted for the family style chef\\'s selection plus wine pairing.  This turned out to be a great choice because we got to try a lot of different things and didn\\'t have to make any decisions.  Everything was so good, with larger portions than a traditional tasting menu, and well-paced. We did order an additional dish of the Roasted Marrow, because it wasn\\'t part of the Chef\\'s Selections, and come on, the place is called Marrow! We were glad we did, because it was delicious. It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical). We will definitely be back to Marrow- there are still so many delicious things on the menu left to try, plus there\\'s brunch!\"', ' \"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I\\'d do it.  The atmosphere is unparalleled with the butcher shop in the main room of the restaurant. Once we were seated in the dining room, our waiter was prompt in greeting us and telling us about the farm to table style the restaurant runs by. Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!  He also asked us about any allergies or food restrictions which is such a personalized touch, it made the entire thing feel like it was personalized for us. I wasn\\'t totally sure of some of the wine selections and he knew his stuff and how to pair to compliment our meals.  We went with our waiters recommendation to sample the menu with the 7 dishes they chose and brought out in a course style meal. They also brought my husband a surprise dessert for his birthday that was completely comped.

Some of my favorites are the pork skin popcorn, dumplings, marrow itself and scallops. Services staff and kitchen put the guest experience first. On my second visit, when the brunch dumplings were sold out, they ended up making dinner dumplings for the table, which was very appreciated. Cocktail list is always on point and you can typically get a reservation, which is a plus.\"', ' \"One the better restaurants around. Went because of some reviews and must say we were very pleased!\\\\nA lot of interesting things on the menu some things I probably would not order. We decide to do the Chef selections and couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\\\nGot a selection of six plates and did an upgrade to try the bone marrow. Noticed some people came in had a plate or two and a cocktail or wine. Had an excellent Rose from Corsica recommend by our server. Not overly pricey we will definitely return.\"', ' \"Best Thing I Ever Ate: Kasekrainer Sausage\\\\n\\\\nI stopped in to give Marrow another try. This time I got the kasekrainer sausage and the Smoked Ham. The Kasekrainer is the best brautwust I\\'ve ever had. The meat had a complex smoky flavor, indicating the use of more than one type of wood. There was a slight bit of spice, giving a pleasant peppery bite. Even better, the sausages were filled with butterkase cheese. \\\\n\\\\nThe Smoked Ham was delightful - Perfectly smoked with a sweet meaty flavor. It made a wonderful croque monsieur sandwich. I would definitely order more than next time I stop by.\"', ' \"The meal I had here last Thursday was one of the best meals of my life. The server was excellent. The bartender was so thoughtful and helpful it was just great. But the meal - the meal! - we ordered all the entrees and shared and they were all - the steak, the lamb, the pork shoulder - beyond delicious. We all left agreeing that it was one of the nicest dinners we had experienced in a long, long time.\"', ' \"What a breath of fresh air in Grosse Pointe. The ambience is new, hip and embraces hipster culture. \\\\nMy husband and I ordered the special which allows you to have samples from different meats and cheeses.

But all was forgiven once we experienced the food! \\\\n\\\\nRibeye was well worth the upsell. Silky scallops and fluffy meatballs were our favorites! Also loved the terrine. Was almost too full for main course when it arrived!\"', ' \"Great concept. They buy a cow, butcher it inside the restaurant when closed (yes, actually in the dining room), age the meat, then either sell it from the butcher shop or serve it in the restaurant.  Located in an area of town that is still in a transition stage, it took a brave entrepreneur to do this project. And the reward was a James Beard nomination for best new restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance: Very comfortable, bistro-like, trendy, but understated. Great design and build out.\\\\n\\\\nWine list: Owner also owns a wine bar in Detroit so knows her stuff. Too bad her palate and my palate are polar opposites.  Not much on the wine list I like. Wish she would diversify. \\\\n\\\\nService: All trained professional servers, but not over-the-top. Our server was a bit slow and kept disappearing, but it did take away from the experience. \\\\n\\\\nMenu: surprisingly, not very meat-centric.  About half the entr\\\\u00e9es are vegetarian.  Creative and diverse. Charcuterie changes regularly. Prices seem to be extremely reasonable.  \\\\n\\\\nFood: all solid, but with one exception, none of it was like \\\\\"oh my gosh, this is delicious!\\\\\". The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.  Curious to try their steak next time.I\"', ' \"I have been spreading the word about this spot in West Village since I dined here.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a butcher shop restaurant combo located on Kercheval Ave. They have a small parking lot off the side of the building, but also unpaid street parking is available.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is small, so I would highly suggest calling ahead if you have a big group to see if they will make accommodations. \\\\n\\\\nGreat menu selection, with dishes that seemed Asian inspired, I loved everything we ordered. The tartare was great(you\\'ll notice it isn\\'t served with the typical quail egg) except I prefer when they serve the dish with toasted baguette slices opposed to kettle like chips. Loved the cauliflower with the feta and yellow raisins. Also honorable mention: the radish slaw.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I went with the Dry Aged Chef\\'s choice. It was awesome. A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive.

This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn\\'t need one. It wasn\\'t crowded at all at that hour.) Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage.

We\\'ll be back for sure.\"', ' \"Had the chance to check out Marrow during a soft opening. Eater.com had labeled it as one of the most anticipated restaurant openings in Detroit this fall. Marrow was on point from beginning to end. We were able to try a number of dishes starting with options for charcuterie, the cabbage Caesar with kimchi dressing (solid!), rice dumplings, fore-quarter beef and dessert which was completely legit. I\\'ll be back, bar scene will definitely not disappoint as well, you\\'ll want to chill and enjoy any one of their solid wines by the glass....\\\\n\\\\nAsk for Stephanie to wait on you, you\\'ll thank me later. She makes the experience what it should be, unforgettable. A true server in every word, peeps like her are what the dining scene is all about in the D.

Both the beef \\\\u0026 mushroom tartare are a must. Tried, delivered and highly recommended. \\\\n\\\\nThe butcher shop sales all types of cuts of meats and house-made stocks for walk in customers.

The dishes are very complicated but could be thought out better. \\\\nI won\\'t be back, only because if I\\'m spending so much money, I would like leave feeling full or amazed. \\\\nWe had the crispy rice salad, wanton soup, beef tar tar, and dumplings. The wanton soup lacked dimension, and the portion size was embarrassing, and entree size soup, it had 3 wantons in it. \\\\nBeef tar tar was over worked and not enough cracker to share or eat the whole dish. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe a little too much show and not enough satisfying.\\\\n\\\\nAnd for me, putting a business here with these prices in a neighborhood where people don\\'t have running water is very sad.\"', ' \"The atmosphere and service was great.\\\\nWe ordered Chef\\'s tasting and all the dishes were excellent.

I recommend getting that for your first trip there, it really gives you a great feel for many items on their menu!

It could have been my high expectations of the place, but it fell just a tad short of what I wanted. The first few dishes were excellent but the brussel sprouts and NY strip I got was very salty.

The atmosphere was great but more importantly the service was excellent, our server Lauren was the best!\"', ' \"Ate brunch Sunday, December 29.  It was just ok.  The worst part was what we ordered to go from the butcher.  The beef roast was 37.50.  When opened the next day it appeared sticky and slimy.  Called the butcher, he said that is to be expected from dry aged meat.  Went to the Grocery store 2 times to buy ingredients for an Ina Garten recipe.  Prepared the dish.  Making sure the temperature was medium and it rested 20 minutes.  Looked good.  Couldn\\'t even chew it.  Never in my life have a ever tasted such a bland, tuff piece of meat!  What a waste of time and money.  I did call the butcher and received the credit for the meat!\"', ' \"I really wanted to wait a few days before I did my review of Morrow but I haven\\'t stopped thinking about it since I left there so I feel compelled to put my thoughts on the Fantastic experience at Morrow. First of all it\\'s not a super large establishment it\\'s actually what I would classify as the right size for premium service. Upon arriving at Morrow they were quite busy but not too busy for one of the three greeters at the door to greet me with a smile and ask how many would be with our party. They did say there\\'s two open seats at the bar but hold on let me see if we can get you at the chef\\'s table. Sure Nuff next thing you know I\\'m seated at the chef\\'s table looking at a menu that is totally amazing. Where do you start well Robert was there to help make some of the decisions we started with the Glutinous Rice Dumplings with meat filling and local roe upon arrival they looked amazing but the taste was truly incredible after taking the first bite your head and you\\'re body kind of enters a different universe and then after you chew and absorb the flavors and the texture you return back to Earth and say wow I\\'ve got to do that again and guess what with 3 dumplings you get multiple shots at it. Upon finishing the dumplings we ordered the daily steak selection which just happened to be ribeye we also ordered the Cured Scallops with parsnip puree grilled bok choy toasted peanuts and pomegranate.  I really don\\'t want to write a book about our experience at Marrows but let\\'s start with the ribeye the presentation phenomenal, as always in a higher-end restaurant I had the chef cook it to his preference let me tell you it was perfect the condiments that came with the steak were even more outrageous then I could have imagined what an experience dining on such a fine piece of meat graced with wonderful vegetables prepared excellently. The cured scallops where nothing short of marvelous every aspect on the plate was utilized for a flavor profile that cannot be explained on a review on Yelp it would require someone with a much better understanding of the English language to explain how truly marvellous the entire dining experience at Morrow was. Thank you for placing yourself in the city of Detroit for everyone to have an opportunity to dine like royalty, rock stars, and the ultra-elite. If I could give you one piece of advice it would be don\\'t change a thing because you can\\'t perfect perfection.\"', ' \"Great restaurant with a diverse menu full of really tasty selections. Easy parking on the street. Cool decor with several types of seating: communal picnic tables, a bar overlooking the kitchen, and regular tables. They also have a nice outdoor patio. We sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the chefs work. Had a great waitress who was really friendly and took great care of us. The food varies from small appetizers to small entrees, all of them shareable. To avoid too long of review, as we ordered a lot of stuff, I will just say that everything was great!! Tasty and well prepared. The only criticism I would have is that it is kinda pricey for the small servings you get. That\\'s why we ordered a lot of things, that being said, you get what you pay for. I feel it was well worth the price as the food was so good. They also have a meat counter where we took home some of the best bacon I\\'ve ever had (cooked for breakfast the next day). We will definitely be back for the food and that bacon!!!\"', ' \"Marrow knocks it out of the park from ambiance to every food item we tried on the menu. I was impressed by their large drink menu, and the reasonable bottle prices. We started off with a delicious bottle of champagne, but one thing to note is that they don\\'t pour your champagne when you need refills, which is surprising for a $100+ pp restaurant. We started with squash blossoms and a meat and cheese mini board, both extremely fresh and delicious. For our main, we chose the market steak (NY Strip $50) and Nick\\'s pick which was an italian sausage with a corn butter medley. If you have the opportunity to order sausage, which we had for both the board and a main, GET IT! It was seriously amazing both hot and cold. Finally, we wrapped it up with the Strawberry Shortcake. Order that one too, the strawberry ice cream and two biscuits were just incredible. Yes, this place is expensive, but yes it is worth it.\"', ' \"I have dined here twice since it opened, and I have to say, both were amazing experiences. It is a very small restaurant with a butcher shop and cocktail bar near the entry. They also have seating next to their kitchen, so you can watch your food being prepared from when it\\'s ordered to when it is expoed out to you. \\\\nThey have a rotating menu, so you never have to try the same thing twice! One of my favorites that seems to be a keeper on their menu is the pickled shrimp; there is a great balance of the bright pickle with a sweet corn butter and fresh toast. Absolutely phenomenal. \\\\n\\\\nNow, on my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I had truly one of the best experiences of service I\\'ve ever had. I, sadly, don\\'t recall his name, but our waiter had very detailed and accurate descriptors for each dish, wonderfully calm mannerisms, and perfectly balanced being present at the table and giving us space to enjoy the experience. A few of the highlights of our most recent visit was the firecracker shrimp, dry aged house beef with sunchokes and horseradish creme fresh, and the Brussel sprouts. For desert, the chocolate pot is TO DIE FOR. \\\\nIf you have the opportunity to dine with marrow, take it. Or call me. ;)\"', ' \"Lived in NOLA for 13 years and this is hands down my favorite restaurant! I enjoy literally EVERYTHING on the menu and I am a \\\\\"picky\\\\\" eater. I always recommend the guests that stay in my Airbnb\\'s to go to Morrow\\'s! They\\'re always pleasantly surprised!\"', ' \"Wow, this place was Great !\\\\nWent here on our anniversary, made on line reservation and then for the heck of it I stopped in earlier on the day of our anniversary just to verify and check out the place.  I talked to the hostess Kate and assured me that our reservation was all set for later that day.  Then she said, your anniversary huh, I\\'m going to set you at my Favorite Table, which turned out to be perfect.  Our waitress that night was really great, she explained the menu, We ordered some stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer along with a couple of craft beers.  For dinner we went with two of their specials for the day, some super tasty Lamb Chops and a Beef Tenderloin that not only was extremely tender but honestly rates up as one of my two top favorite steaks I have ever eaten and the other one was The Chicago Chop House in Chicago 25 years ago.  This is a small, quaint place with some outstanding food.  Bonus that they are also a butcher shop with prime beef, pork, specialty sausages, lunch meats and more that you can purchase to take home or as we learned, pick an item and have the waitress ask the chef as to how they will prepare it for you right there.  This is a Great Place for any special day.\"', ' \"Went on a wintry week night, so the place was very low key.  Which was nice, because I had to unexpectedly bump the rezzies at the last minute.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the vibe:  very gentrified.  Our server was training someone who usually worked the brunch shift.  When I ordered an old-fashioned, they even checked with the bartender to make a recommendation.  Both knew the menu pretty well, but faltered when asked exactly WHERE the local beef came from...it\\'s Detroit, after all, and you don\\'t exactly see cows out to pasture...\\\\n\\\\nThey asked about food allergies and worked closely with the chef to figure out dishes that might have coconut.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several dishes.  The biggest hits were the marrow (you gotta order the namesake dish), especially the marrow poufs served along side; and the steak tartare (truly something special).\\\\n\\\\nNot an every night joint, but I definitely look forward to going back again!\"', ' \"Honestly fabulous. Such an intimate, cool space without being pretentious. The food was amazing, expect a lot of lovely flavor pairings, not your traditional meat and potatoes! I had the scallops which were lovely. Highly recommend checking out this place, perfect for a special date without putting a huge dent in your pocket.\"', ' \"Walking in the door I felt like a child in a candy store, this place is amazing. There isn\\'t one detail left out. Everything is so beautifully displayed and open. \\\\nThe bar is one of the first things you notice walking in. It\\'s clean with a wonderful selection of liquors, wine and a few well selected drafts. The back splash for the bar is a sheet of glass over the natural brick. Sealing in the old and new together. Really cool. \\\\nNext is the meat! Wow, there isn\\'t a single finger print on these display cases and honestly I don\\'t know how cause I didn\\'t want to keep my hands off. \\\\nEverything is so fresh and the prices are outstanding for the cuts. \\\\nThe dining room is so open, modern and fun. You can see into the back of the house and I\\'ve always personally enjoyed that aspect of restaurants giving you that bit of vulnerability. The chairs were one of my favorite things, they almost move with you. Giving you a at home feeling while eating amazing dishes. \\\\nThis restaurant is a perfect fit on a street in Detroit you can feel passion radiating out of. \\\\nThe staff I had the chance to personally meet were all so welcoming, warm and helpful. You can tell they all truly enjoy working with each other as a team. Ownership is strongly present and has created a well established team, home and thriving restaurant. \\\\nGood job marrow.\"']\n",

We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\", \"author\": \"Pawel G.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2019-01-03\", \"description\": \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\n\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn't miss the fact that there wasn't any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I've had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I'll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can't complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn't season the steak, which I guess they didn't need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don't mind, but if you're a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\n\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I'm honestly not sure if I just don't really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\n\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I'd come often at all. But food was DELISH.

We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\n\\nBecause it's the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\n\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\n\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don't have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they're offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\n\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu.

They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\"nice\\\" restaurant. \\n\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn't even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I've never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\n\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\n\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to.

      " [' \"A small restaurant with a meat shop inside. Nice! The food was tasty. We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\"', ' \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\\\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn\\'t miss the fact that there wasn\\'t any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I\\'ve had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I\\'ll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can\\'t complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\\\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn\\'t season the steak, which I guess they didn\\'t need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\\\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don\\'t mind, but if you\\'re a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\\\n\\\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I\\'m honestly not sure if I just don\\'t really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I\\'d come often at all. But food was DELISH. Ambiance was kind of romantic with soft lighting.\"', ' \"Phenomenal! We went here for my husbands birthday and this place did not disappoint. We started with the rice dumplings. I cannot explain how wonderful these dumplings were! For dinner we had their two specials: one was cassoulet with a French style sausage (the real winner was the pieces of French baguette they had with it) and a picanha (top sirloin steak) with kimchi and sunflower roots. I honestly don\\'t think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food, staff, and overall atmosphere were just perfect. Can\\'t wait to come back and try the family style chef\\'s menu!\"', ' \"I really enjoyed my dinner here and so did my 4 companions. We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\\\n\\\\nBecause it\\'s the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don\\'t have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\\\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they\\'re offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\\\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu. Plus I think I want to come back and buy some meat from the butcher side - looked at a few things as I was leaving and thought the quality and price looked great.\"', ' \"Excellent food, Excellent service, and great atmosphere.  I strongly recommend anyone looking for a nice couples night out or date night to visit Marrow.  The food is unique and delicious and the service was as good as it gets.  I can\\'t wait to go back!\"', ' \"Ummmmm , not so much. The most minuscule portion sizes of the appetizers will be a lasting memory. Ate at the bar and the bar tender was 110% on point - interacting with him more memorable than the food. In fact I can\\'t remember what any of us ate. This is a very expensive dining experience - for foodies the value may be there but I\\'m no longer a foodie and I\\'m now the type who realizes I could have  purchased a couple of nice pieces of clothing for the price of my dinner. I\\'m glad they are there and I wish them every success - they have worked very hard to create a unique experience but I\\'m not their target customer . And they were just announced as one of the 16 best restaurants in the United States. So congratulations, sincerely\"', ' \"This review only speaks to customer service, as we decided to leave the restaurant before eating. They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\\\"nice\\\\\" restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn\\'t even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I\\'ve never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to. This place and some of their staff definitely came off to me like they were \\\\\"trying too hard\\\\\" and soberly striving to reach some \\\\\"it factor\\\\\" of culinary coolness. I\\'m getting too old for that nonsense.\"', ' \"Oh my.  Determined to dine in West Village, the four of us descended upon Marrow last night.  We all had the chef\\'s menu...7-8 courses with each one fantastic.  The chef adjusted on the fly and added a tenderloin for my daughter (grilled perfectly).  My guess is that everything on the menu is fantastic, but do yourself a favor and have their scallops.  They\\'re grilled on a sort of wood box grill that adds the perfect touch of smokiness to the dish.  From Anchorage to Seattle to New York to LA, Marrow has the best scallops I\\'ve ever had.  Lastly, our server was fantastic, fun and engaging.  Can\\'t wait to go back.\"', ' \"Super impressed with this place. Went there and got the tasting menu. At first I was nervous because the portions were on the smaller side but there was so much food that came out I left stuffed. I highly recommend trying this place and doing the tasting menu. It was relatively inexpensive for a steakhouse and worth every penny.\"', ' \"Marrow was an absolutely wonderful experience. From decor, to flow of the restaurant, service, and the main star of the evening the food. We started with the charcuterie which was full of flavor, followed by the marrow toast which was a delight. Next had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, followed by the \\\\\"From the Butchers Case\\\\\" which was lamb kafta. The lamb was wonderfully cooked and tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend this restaurant.\"', ' \"Wow.  Yum.  Each dish was exceptional and unique.  The restaurant is lovely with a great staff.  Everyone was wonderful but our server Stephanie was amazing and made the night extra special. Will be back and also try the butcher shop.\"', ' \"Disappointing. Another go starving and leave hungry eatery. No hearty beef dishes on menu despite walking by the impressive aging display, meats In deli counter.  Skimpy expensive portions. Service was good. Cool digs not enough to warrant a return visit.\"', ' \"We celebrated our first year anniversary last night and couldn\\'t be happier with the service/food.

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish.

Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience.

Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented.

It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.

Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.

Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!

I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience.

As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible.

Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene.

I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.

I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting.

I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety.

The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky.

It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical).

Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!

They buy a cow, butcher it inside the restaurant when closed (yes, actually in the dining room), age the meat, then either sell it from the butcher shop or serve it in the restaurant.

The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.

A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive.

This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn\\'t need one. It wasn\\'t crowded at all at that hour.) Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage. Diners of today are more invested than ever in animal welfare and local farms -- it\\'s a pleasure to support a business that extends the same concern to its people. | MarrowDetroit.com\\\\n\\\\n-- Brenna Houck, Eater Detroit editor\"', ' \"Prawns in the seasonal yakatori were slimy - after they told me \\\\\"the chef wasn\\'t happy with the quality of the seafood, so they\\'re making you another plate and it will be out shortly\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nMy husband ordered the local beef medium rare ($50) which came out rare, at best, and was full of gristle. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t go here.\\\\n\\\\n7/14 update - We are not looking for a free meal and won\\'t be back.

The cured scallops where nothing short of marvelous every aspect on the plate was utilized for a flavor profile that cannot be explained on a review on Yelp it would require someone with a much better understanding of the English language to explain how truly marvellous the entire dining experience at Morrow was. Thank you for placing yourself in the city of Detroit for everyone to have an opportunity to dine like royalty, rock stars, and the ultra-elite. If I could give you one piece of advice it would be don\\'t change a thing because you can\\'t perfect perfection.\"', ' \"Great restaurant with a diverse menu full of really tasty selections. Easy parking on the street. Cool decor with several types of seating: communal picnic tables, a bar overlooking the kitchen, and regular tables. They also have a nice outdoor patio. We sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the chefs work. Had a great waitress who was really friendly and took great care of us. The food varies from small appetizers to small entrees, all of them shareable. To avoid too long of review, as we ordered a lot of stuff, I will just say that everything was great!! Tasty and well prepared. The only criticism I would have is that it is kinda pricey for the small servings you get. That\\'s why we ordered a lot of things, that being said, you get what you pay for. I feel it was well worth the price as the food was so good. They also have a meat counter where we took home some of the best bacon I\\'ve ever had (cooked for breakfast the next day). We will definitely be back for the food and that bacon!!!\"', ' \"Marrow knocks it out of the park from ambiance to every food item we tried on the menu. I was impressed by their large drink menu, and the reasonable bottle prices. We started off with a delicious bottle of champagne, but one thing to note is that they don\\'t pour your champagne when you need refills, which is surprising for a $100+ pp restaurant. We started with squash blossoms and a meat and cheese mini board, both extremely fresh and delicious. For our main, we chose the market steak (NY Strip $50) and Nick\\'s pick which was an italian sausage with a corn butter medley. If you have the opportunity to order sausage, which we had for both the board and a main, GET IT! It was seriously amazing both hot and cold. Finally, we wrapped it up with the Strawberry Shortcake. Order that one too, the strawberry ice cream and two biscuits were just incredible. Yes, this place is expensive, but yes it is worth it.\"', ' \"I have dined here twice since it opened, and I have to say, both were amazing experiences. It is a very small restaurant with a butcher shop and cocktail bar near the entry. They also have seating next to their kitchen, so you can watch your food being prepared from when it\\'s ordered to when it is expoed out to you. \\\\nThey have a rotating menu, so you never have to try the same thing twice! One of my favorites that seems to be a keeper on their menu is the pickled shrimp; there is a great balance of the bright pickle with a sweet corn butter and fresh toast. Absolutely phenomenal. \\\\n\\\\nNow, on my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I had truly one of the best experiences of service I\\'ve ever had. I, sadly, don\\'t recall his name, but our waiter had very detailed and accurate descriptors for each dish, wonderfully calm mannerisms, and perfectly balanced being present at the table and giving us space to enjoy the experience. A few of the highlights of our most recent visit was the firecracker shrimp, dry aged house beef with sunchokes and horseradish creme fresh, and the Brussel sprouts. For desert, the chocolate pot is TO DIE FOR. \\\\nIf you have the opportunity to dine with marrow, take it. Or call me. ;)\"', ' \"Lived in NOLA for 13 years and this is hands down my favorite restaurant! I enjoy literally EVERYTHING on the menu and I am a \\\\\"picky\\\\\" eater. I always recommend the guests that stay in my Airbnb\\'s to go to Morrow\\'s! They\\'re always pleasantly surprised!\"', ' \"Wow, this place was Great !\\\\nWent here on our anniversary, made on line reservation and then for the heck of it I stopped in earlier on the day of our anniversary just to verify and check out the place.  I talked to the hostess Kate and assured me that our reservation was all set for later that day.  Then she said, your anniversary huh, I\\'m going to set you at my Favorite Table, which turned out to be perfect.  Our waitress that night was really great, she explained the menu, We ordered some stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer along with a couple of craft beers.  For dinner we went with two of their specials for the day, some super tasty Lamb Chops and a Beef Tenderloin that not only was extremely tender but honestly rates up as one of my two top favorite steaks I have ever eaten and the other one was The Chicago Chop House in Chicago 25 years ago.  This is a small, quaint place with some outstanding food.  Bonus that they are also a butcher shop with prime beef, pork, specialty sausages, lunch meats and more that you can purchase to take home or as we learned, pick an item and have the waitress ask the chef as to how they will prepare it for you right there.  This is a Great Place for any special day.\"', ' \"Went on a wintry week night, so the place was very low key.  Which was nice, because I had to unexpectedly bump the rezzies at the last minute.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the vibe:  very gentrified.  Our server was training someone who usually worked the brunch shift.  When I ordered an old-fashioned, they even checked with the bartender to make a recommendation.  Both knew the menu pretty well, but faltered when asked exactly WHERE the local beef came from...it\\'s Detroit, after all, and you don\\'t exactly see cows out to pasture...\\\\n\\\\nThey asked about food allergies and worked closely with the chef to figure out dishes that might have coconut.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several dishes.  The biggest hits were the marrow (you gotta order the namesake dish), especially the marrow poufs served along side; and the steak tartare (truly something special).\\\\n\\\\nNot an every night joint, but I definitely look forward to going back again!\"', ' \"Honestly fabulous. Such an intimate, cool space without being pretentious. The food was amazing, expect a lot of lovely flavor pairings, not your traditional meat and potatoes! I had the scallops which were lovely. Highly recommend checking out this place, perfect for a special date without putting a huge dent in your pocket.\"', ' \"Walking in the door I felt like a child in a candy store, this place is amazing. There isn\\'t one detail left out. Everything is so beautifully displayed and open. \\\\nThe bar is one of the first things you notice walking in. It\\'s clean with a wonderful selection of liquors, wine and a few well selected drafts. The back splash for the bar is a sheet of glass over the natural brick. Sealing in the old and new together. Really cool. \\\\nNext is the meat! Wow, there isn\\'t a single finger print on these display cases and honestly I don\\'t know how cause I didn\\'t want to keep my hands off. \\\\nEverything is so fresh and the prices are outstanding for the cuts. \\\\nThe dining room is so open, modern and fun. You can see into the back of the house and I\\'ve always personally enjoyed that aspect of restaurants giving you that bit of vulnerability. The chairs were one of my favorite things, they almost move with you. Giving you a at home feeling while eating amazing dishes. \\\\nThis restaurant is a perfect fit on a street in Detroit you can feel passion radiating out of. \\\\nThe staff I had the chance to personally meet were all so welcoming, warm and helpful. You can tell they all truly enjoy working with each other as a team. Ownership is strongly present and has created a well established team, home and thriving restaurant. \\\\nGood job marrow.\"', ' \"A small restaurant with a meat shop inside. Nice! The food was tasty. We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\"', ' \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\\\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn\\'t miss the fact that there wasn\\'t any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I\\'ve had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I\\'ll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can\\'t complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\\\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn\\'t season the steak, which I guess they didn\\'t need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\\\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don\\'t mind, but if you\\'re a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\\\n\\\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I\\'m honestly not sure if I just don\\'t really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I\\'d come often at all. But food was DELISH. Ambiance was kind of romantic with soft lighting.\"', ' \"Phenomenal! We went here for my husbands birthday and this place did not disappoint. We started with the rice dumplings. I cannot explain how wonderful these dumplings were! For dinner we had their two specials: one was cassoulet with a French style sausage (the real winner was the pieces of French baguette they had with it) and a picanha (top sirloin steak) with kimchi and sunflower roots. I honestly don\\'t think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food, staff, and overall atmosphere were just perfect. Can\\'t wait to come back and try the family style chef\\'s menu!\"', ' \"I really enjoyed my dinner here and so did my 4 companions. We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\\\n\\\\nBecause it\\'s the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don\\'t have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\\\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they\\'re offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\\\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu. Plus I think I want to come back and buy some meat from the butcher side - looked at a few things as I was leaving and thought the quality and price looked great.\"', ' \"Excellent food, Excellent service, and great atmosphere.  I strongly recommend anyone looking for a nice couples night out or date night to visit Marrow.  The food is unique and delicious and the service was as good as it gets.  I can\\'t wait to go back!\"', ' \"Ummmmm , not so much. The most minuscule portion sizes of the appetizers will be a lasting memory. Ate at the bar and the bar tender was 110% on point - interacting with him more memorable than the food. In fact I can\\'t remember what any of us ate. This is a very expensive dining experience - for foodies the value may be there but I\\'m no longer a foodie and I\\'m now the type who realizes I could have  purchased a couple of nice pieces of clothing for the price of my dinner. I\\'m glad they are there and I wish them every success - they have worked very hard to create a unique experience but I\\'m not their target customer . And they were just announced as one of the 16 best restaurants in the United States. So congratulations, sincerely\"', ' \"This review only speaks to customer service, as we decided to leave the restaurant before eating. They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\\\"nice\\\\\" restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn\\'t even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I\\'ve never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to. This place and some of their staff definitely came off to me like they were \\\\\"trying too hard\\\\\" and soberly striving to reach some \\\\\"it factor\\\\\" of culinary coolness. I\\'m getting too old for that nonsense.\"', ' \"Oh my.  Determined to dine in West Village, the four of us descended upon Marrow last night.  We all had the chef\\'s menu...7-8 courses with each one fantastic.  The chef adjusted on the fly and added a tenderloin for my daughter (grilled perfectly).  My guess is that everything on the menu is fantastic, but do yourself a favor and have their scallops.  They\\'re grilled on a sort of wood box grill that adds the perfect touch of smokiness to the dish.  From Anchorage to Seattle to New York to LA, Marrow has the best scallops I\\'ve ever had.  Lastly, our server was fantastic, fun and engaging.  Can\\'t wait to go back.\"', ' \"Super impressed with this place. Went there and got the tasting menu. At first I was nervous because the portions were on the smaller side but there was so much food that came out I left stuffed. I highly recommend trying this place and doing the tasting menu. It was relatively inexpensive for a steakhouse and worth every penny.\"', ' \"Marrow was an absolutely wonderful experience. From decor, to flow of the restaurant, service, and the main star of the evening the food. We started with the charcuterie which was full of flavor, followed by the marrow toast which was a delight. Next had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, followed by the \\\\\"From the Butchers Case\\\\\" which was lamb kafta. The lamb was wonderfully cooked and tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend this restaurant.\"', ' \"Wow.  Yum.  Each dish was exceptional and unique.  The restaurant is lovely with a great staff.  Everyone was wonderful but our server Stephanie was amazing and made the night extra special. Will be back and also try the butcher shop.\"', ' \"Disappointing. Another go starving and leave hungry eatery. No hearty beef dishes on menu despite walking by the impressive aging display, meats In deli counter.  Skimpy expensive portions. Service was good. Cool digs not enough to warrant a return visit.\"', ' \"We celebrated our first year anniversary last night and couldn\\'t be happier with the service/food. Marrow is definitely worth checking out!\"', ' \"Great brunch spot and good cocktails.  Butcher counter is the best in the city.  Great little patio in the summer.

Steak truly cooked the right way!\"', ' \"Excellent food, friendly service and even better atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nReservation is recommend specially over the weekend\"', ' \"This is a butcher shop and restaurant. They had one red meat offering at 55 dollars. I do not understand how a shop filled with red meat could only offer one red meat meal.  I kept asking you have a wall full of meat and you only offer one steak at dollars , I do not understand !\"', ' \"I visited Marrow for the first time last night, at the recommendation of a friend.  We started with the Bao and Butter.  The boa buns had a flavorful seasoning and were fluffy and light, almost reminiscent of a soft pretzel crossed with a traditional bao.  They came with a hearty helping of seaweed infused butter.  A delicious warm up to the meal.\\\\nNext up was the Charcuterie.  We had the Pork Rillette and a cheese whose name escapes me which came with a blueberry spread as well as crackers.  The rillete was delicious paired with the blueberry spread, as well as the cheese we selected.\\\\nNext was the Steak Tartare.  This was a different take on tartare than I\\'ve experienced previously.  It was left more chunky than pureed (a big plus to me!) and was infused with citrus and cilantro flavors, and served with a seaweed fortune cookie as it\\'s delivery mechanism.  It is truly the best tartare I have had, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!\\\\nNow, the Roasted Bone Marrow. This was the crown jewel of the night.  A monster piece of bone, filled with delicious marrow, topped with herbs and pickled blueberries.  It was served with pate a choux puffs, which you filled to make a savory puff.  This melt in your mouth explosion of flavor is something you must experience for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and order this dish.\\\\nFinally, we had the Spicy Szechuan Udon Noodles with corned pork tongue.  The tongue was flavorful, tender, and there was ample amounts of it in the dish.  The udon was well cooked and the sauce was just enough spice to build up nicely without being overwhelming.  This dish also included fiddlehead ferns, which I had never had but reminded me of a nicely charred asparagus!\\\\n\\\\nI have nothing but compliments on my meal here! In addition, this 5 dish meal was $100 total, split between two people, which for the quality, thought, and preparation of the meal and knowledgeable server suggestions, is hard to beat.\"']\n",

The 3 stars is for the food unfortunately. It's a great concept and and I love that it's located in a transition area and will hopefully bring energy and a bit of cool new Detroit vibe to the area. We liked the ambience and the service was good. Appetizers and smaller plates were good, the bao buns were worth coming back for. But larger plates looked and sounded great but some ultimately just didn't taste great or lacked balance. Corned tongue was pretty good. Shrimp stir fry was pretty good if a bit too salty (a side of plain rice would have made it perfect). Michigan beef special (Brazilian style?) had a lot going on but was just ok. And Bao burger special in particular was almost inedible. It's as if someone came up with the concept but no one actually tasted the dish before selling it to the customers. Beef tasted uncooked even though it was cooked to medium per our request, the bun was salty and had a mouth feel like under-baked dough. Kimchi didn't do anything for the dish except to accentuate the weird taste of the beef. A straight up well grilled burger on a toasted bun would have been a way better way to feature good beef. With the luxury of a good butcher shop on premise, I wish they'd focus more on the goodness that is a good piece of seared, caramelized, well salted meat and less on making it so complicated and trendy. I know the menu changes all the time so maybe we went on an off night/week?

      " [' \"I\\'ve been looking forward to trying this place since the James Beard semifinalist lists came out and I really wanted to love it. The 3 stars is for the food unfortunately. It\\'s a great concept and and I love that it\\'s located in a transition area and will hopefully bring energy and a bit of cool new Detroit vibe to the area. We liked the ambience and the service was good. Appetizers and smaller plates were good, the bao buns were worth coming back for. But larger plates looked and sounded great but some ultimately just didn\\'t taste great or lacked balance. Corned tongue was pretty good. Shrimp stir fry was pretty good if a bit too salty (a side of plain rice would have made it perfect). Michigan beef special (Brazilian style?) had a lot going on but was just ok. And Bao burger special in particular was almost inedible. It\\'s as if someone came up with the concept but no one actually tasted the dish before selling it to the customers. Beef tasted uncooked even though it was cooked to medium per our request, the bun was salty and had a mouth feel like under-baked dough. Kimchi didn\\'t do anything for the dish except to accentuate the weird taste of the beef. A straight up well grilled burger on a toasted bun would have been a way better way to feature good beef. With the luxury of a good butcher shop on premise, I wish they\\'d focus more on the goodness that is a good piece of seared, caramelized, well salted meat and less on making it so complicated and trendy. I know the menu changes all the time so maybe we went on an off night/week? Will have to give it another try but I\\'m not sure I\\'d run back here given so many other options in Detroit.\"', ' \"Excellent and creative menu. Wine and liquors are from local wineries and distilleries. Options for vegetarians as well.\"', ' \"Amazing addition to the neighborhood! Been a couple times now and have been blown away by the quality of the food and the wine selection! \\\\n\\\\nStarted with a huge charcuterie (the pickled shrimp is so tasty), then moved on to the radicchio salad, tempura delicata squash (phenomenal!), and Mapo Mushrooms. \\\\n\\\\nAll the food is amazing, but the noodles and broth is life changing! The broth is complex and full of flavor topped with a silk smooth duck egg....I\\'ve never had a \\\\\"ramen\\\\\" so tasty!\\\\n\\\\nHad several great desserts and more than a few bottles of wine. \\\\n\\\\nStaff and management are all well seasoned professionals and really know how to treat their guests. :)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck it out, I doubt you\\'ll be disappointed.\"', ' \"Came in last week and sat at the counter for a really indulgent and enjoyable night. Our server was incredibly attentive and thorough, taking the utmost care that my friend\\'s shellfish allergy was accommodated and ensuring that we were totally content all evening, which we certainly were! My companion and I shared a charcuterie board, the roasted cauliflower, the marrow (when in Rome, right?), and a dessert of small donuts that reminded me of a beignet mixed with a churro and a sesame whipped cream. Everything was delectable and intricately finessed, and we had a great experience from top to bottom. So glad to have finally visited!\"', ' \"The food, environment, and ambience are excellent. I love their changing menu salad every time and desserts were also noteworthy. I\\'d like to compliment the staff and owner for their genuine hospitality. It\\'s been a long time since me or my guests have been wowed by a server\\'s excellent attentiveness to detail. Lauren made our night very special and we recommended her to our friends who also recently visited Marrow. They too were blown away. Thanks to the owner, Lauren, and the rest of the staff for making our experiences at Marrow so memorable. Keep up the good work!\"', ' \"I absolutely loved the meal I had here. I can\\'t wait to return. The tartare was fantastic. Every dish was delicious, including the baklava donut dessert. We did not get the tasting menu (we chose to order every dish we wanted individually), but I really appreciated that the waitress told us what would be on the tasting menu since not all places do that. It helped us decide what to do!\"', ' \"Great experience. Really enjoyed everything that I ate. I sat at the bar and chatted up some of the folks. Marrow has a great atmosphere. The restaurant is beautiful and everyone who works there is super friendly. \\\\n\\\\nI had the Red Curry entr\\\\u00e9e. It was divine.\"', ' \"Marrow is a neighborhood bar and what a treat it is! Ping and her team have done amazing job of making a neighborhood bar and butcher a chic, fabulous place to have a cocktail, meet friends and entertain clients.\"', ' \"Get there early if you are looking for something specific at the butcher shop.

The tasting menu is a favorite, offering a wonderful sampling of the chef\\'s talents. At $50, it is a steal! Cocktails are fun and the wine list is lovely. On our last visit, we stopped at the butcher counter and picked up some amazing dry aged beef short ribs. So good!\"', ' \"Unique dining experience awaits you!  I was recommended to this spot as a restaurant and found out it also offers some great items to take home from its market section. Have recommended it to many already. Can\\'t wait to return.

The fried pork popcorn app is super yum and goes great with cocktails. I didn\\'t love the yakitori it was really fatty but I don\\'t know much about Asian cuisine so it could have been an item not suited for me. I had the scallops and I very much enjoyed all of the flavors. The con on this item for me was that it was room temperature almost cold? I didn\\'t care for where my dinner mate and I were seated we were by the end window in a small table that every waiter kept walking through and it made dinner service a little annoying at times. I also didn\\'t care for how the cheese and meat are ala carte but maybe I overlooked an option where you could pick a combo of three or more, or a make your own board or chefs choice.

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now! Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\\\n\\\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful.

I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience.

Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented.

This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.

Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar.

It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience.

Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene.

We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.

I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting.

I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings.

For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd.

It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical).

Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!

Our server was a bit slow and kept disappearing, but it did take away from the experience. \\\\n\\\\nMenu: surprisingly, not very meat-centric.  About half the entr\\\\u00e9es are vegetarian.  Creative and diverse. Charcuterie changes regularly. Prices seem to be extremely reasonable.  \\\\n\\\\nFood: all solid, but with one exception, none of it was like \\\\\"oh my gosh, this is delicious!\\\\\". The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.  Curious to try their steak next time.I\"', ' \"I have been spreading the word about this spot in West Village since I dined here.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a butcher shop restaurant combo located on Kercheval Ave. They have a small parking lot off the side of the building, but also unpaid street parking is available.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is small, so I would highly suggest calling ahead if you have a big group to see if they will make accommodations. \\\\n\\\\nGreat menu selection, with dishes that seemed Asian inspired, I loved everything we ordered. The tartare was great(you\\'ll notice it isn\\'t served with the typical quail egg) except I prefer when they serve the dish with toasted baguette slices opposed to kettle like chips. Loved the cauliflower with the feta and yellow raisins. Also honorable mention: the radish slaw.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I went with the Dry Aged Chef\\'s choice. It was awesome. A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive.

This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish. (We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45, but we didn\\'t need one. It wasn\\'t crowded at all at that hour.) Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage. Diners of today are more invested than ever in animal welfare and local farms -- it\\'s a pleasure to support a business that extends the same concern to its people. | MarrowDetroit.com\\\\n\\\\n-- Brenna Houck, Eater Detroit editor\"', ' \"Prawns in the seasonal yakatori were slimy - after they told me \\\\\"the chef wasn\\'t happy with the quality of the seafood, so they\\'re making you another plate and it will be out shortly\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nMy husband ordered the local beef medium rare ($50) which came out rare, at best, and was full of gristle. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t go here.\\\\n\\\\n7/14 update - We are not looking for a free meal and won\\'t be back.

I, sadly, don\\'t recall his name, but our waiter had very detailed and accurate descriptors for each dish, wonderfully calm mannerisms, and perfectly balanced being present at the table and giving us space to enjoy the experience. A few of the highlights of our most recent visit was the firecracker shrimp, dry aged house beef with sunchokes and horseradish creme fresh, and the Brussel sprouts. For desert, the chocolate pot is TO DIE FOR. \\\\nIf you have the opportunity to dine with marrow, take it. Or call me. ;)\"', ' \"Lived in NOLA for 13 years and this is hands down my favorite restaurant! I enjoy literally EVERYTHING on the menu and I am a \\\\\"picky\\\\\" eater. I always recommend the guests that stay in my Airbnb\\'s to go to Morrow\\'s! They\\'re always pleasantly surprised!\"', ' \"Wow, this place was Great !\\\\nWent here on our anniversary, made on line reservation and then for the heck of it I stopped in earlier on the day of our anniversary just to verify and check out the place.  I talked to the hostess Kate and assured me that our reservation was all set for later that day.  Then she said, your anniversary huh, I\\'m going to set you at my Favorite Table, which turned out to be perfect.  Our waitress that night was really great, she explained the menu, We ordered some stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer along with a couple of craft beers.  For dinner we went with two of their specials for the day, some super tasty Lamb Chops and a Beef Tenderloin that not only was extremely tender but honestly rates up as one of my two top favorite steaks I have ever eaten and the other one was The Chicago Chop House in Chicago 25 years ago.  This is a small, quaint place with some outstanding food.  Bonus that they are also a butcher shop with prime beef, pork, specialty sausages, lunch meats and more that you can purchase to take home or as we learned, pick an item and have the waitress ask the chef as to how they will prepare it for you right there.  This is a Great Place for any special day.\"', ' \"Went on a wintry week night, so the place was very low key.  Which was nice, because I had to unexpectedly bump the rezzies at the last minute.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the vibe:  very gentrified.  Our server was training someone who usually worked the brunch shift.  When I ordered an old-fashioned, they even checked with the bartender to make a recommendation.  Both knew the menu pretty well, but faltered when asked exactly WHERE the local beef came from...it\\'s Detroit, after all, and you don\\'t exactly see cows out to pasture...\\\\n\\\\nThey asked about food allergies and worked closely with the chef to figure out dishes that might have coconut.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several dishes.  The biggest hits were the marrow (you gotta order the namesake dish), especially the marrow poufs served along side; and the steak tartare (truly something special).\\\\n\\\\nNot an every night joint, but I definitely look forward to going back again!\"', ' \"Honestly fabulous. Such an intimate, cool space without being pretentious. The food was amazing, expect a lot of lovely flavor pairings, not your traditional meat and potatoes! I had the scallops which were lovely. Highly recommend checking out this place, perfect for a special date without putting a huge dent in your pocket.\"', ' \"Walking in the door I felt like a child in a candy store, this place is amazing. There isn\\'t one detail left out. Everything is so beautifully displayed and open. \\\\nThe bar is one of the first things you notice walking in. It\\'s clean with a wonderful selection of liquors, wine and a few well selected drafts. The back splash for the bar is a sheet of glass over the natural brick. Sealing in the old and new together. Really cool. \\\\nNext is the meat! Wow, there isn\\'t a single finger print on these display cases and honestly I don\\'t know how cause I didn\\'t want to keep my hands off. \\\\nEverything is so fresh and the prices are outstanding for the cuts. \\\\nThe dining room is so open, modern and fun. You can see into the back of the house and I\\'ve always personally enjoyed that aspect of restaurants giving you that bit of vulnerability. The chairs were one of my favorite things, they almost move with you. Giving you a at home feeling while eating amazing dishes. \\\\nThis restaurant is a perfect fit on a street in Detroit you can feel passion radiating out of. \\\\nThe staff I had the chance to personally meet were all so welcoming, warm and helpful. You can tell they all truly enjoy working with each other as a team. Ownership is strongly present and has created a well established team, home and thriving restaurant. \\\\nGood job marrow.\"', ' \"A small restaurant with a meat shop inside. Nice! The food was tasty. We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\"', ' \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\\\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn\\'t miss the fact that there wasn\\'t any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I\\'ve had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I\\'ll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can\\'t complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\\\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn\\'t season the steak, which I guess they didn\\'t need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\\\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don\\'t mind, but if you\\'re a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\\\n\\\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I\\'m honestly not sure if I just don\\'t really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I\\'d come often at all. But food was DELISH. Ambiance was kind of romantic with soft lighting.\"', ' \"Phenomenal! We went here for my husbands birthday and this place did not disappoint. We started with the rice dumplings. I cannot explain how wonderful these dumplings were! For dinner we had their two specials: one was cassoulet with a French style sausage (the real winner was the pieces of French baguette they had with it) and a picanha (top sirloin steak) with kimchi and sunflower roots. I honestly don\\'t think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food, staff, and overall atmosphere were just perfect. Can\\'t wait to come back and try the family style chef\\'s menu!\"', ' \"I really enjoyed my dinner here and so did my 4 companions. We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\\\n\\\\nBecause it\\'s the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don\\'t have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\\\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they\\'re offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\\\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu. Plus I think I want to come back and buy some meat from the butcher side - looked at a few things as I was leaving and thought the quality and price looked great.\"', ' \"Excellent food, Excellent service, and great atmosphere.  I strongly recommend anyone looking for a nice couples night out or date night to visit Marrow.  The food is unique and delicious and the service was as good as it gets.  I can\\'t wait to go back!\"', ' \"Ummmmm , not so much. The most minuscule portion sizes of the appetizers will be a lasting memory. Ate at the bar and the bar tender was 110% on point - interacting with him more memorable than the food. In fact I can\\'t remember what any of us ate. This is a very expensive dining experience - for foodies the value may be there but I\\'m no longer a foodie and I\\'m now the type who realizes I could have  purchased a couple of nice pieces of clothing for the price of my dinner. I\\'m glad they are there and I wish them every success - they have worked very hard to create a unique experience but I\\'m not their target customer . And they were just announced as one of the 16 best restaurants in the United States. So congratulations, sincerely\"', ' \"This review only speaks to customer service, as we decided to leave the restaurant before eating. They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\\\"nice\\\\\" restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn\\'t even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I\\'ve never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to. This place and some of their staff definitely came off to me like they were \\\\\"trying too hard\\\\\" and soberly striving to reach some \\\\\"it factor\\\\\" of culinary coolness. I\\'m getting too old for that nonsense.\"', ' \"Oh my.  Determined to dine in West Village, the four of us descended upon Marrow last night.  We all had the chef\\'s menu...7-8 courses with each one fantastic.  The chef adjusted on the fly and added a tenderloin for my daughter (grilled perfectly).  My guess is that everything on the menu is fantastic, but do yourself a favor and have their scallops.  They\\'re grilled on a sort of wood box grill that adds the perfect touch of smokiness to the dish.  From Anchorage to Seattle to New York to LA, Marrow has the best scallops I\\'ve ever had.  Lastly, our server was fantastic, fun and engaging.  Can\\'t wait to go back.\"', ' \"Super impressed with this place. Went there and got the tasting menu. At first I was nervous because the portions were on the smaller side but there was so much food that came out I left stuffed. I highly recommend trying this place and doing the tasting menu. It was relatively inexpensive for a steakhouse and worth every penny.\"', ' \"Marrow was an absolutely wonderful experience. From decor, to flow of the restaurant, service, and the main star of the evening the food. We started with the charcuterie which was full of flavor, followed by the marrow toast which was a delight. Next had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, followed by the \\\\\"From the Butchers Case\\\\\" which was lamb kafta. The lamb was wonderfully cooked and tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend this restaurant.\"', ' \"Wow.  Yum.  Each dish was exceptional and unique.  The restaurant is lovely with a great staff.  Everyone was wonderful but our server Stephanie was amazing and made the night extra special. Will be back and also try the butcher shop.\"', ' \"Disappointing. Another go starving and leave hungry eatery. No hearty beef dishes on menu despite walking by the impressive aging display, meats In deli counter.  Skimpy expensive portions. Service was good. Cool digs not enough to warrant a return visit.\"', ' \"We celebrated our first year anniversary last night and couldn\\'t be happier with the service/food. Marrow is definitely worth checking out!\"', ' \"Great brunch spot and good cocktails.  Butcher counter is the best in the city.  Great little patio in the summer.  Knowledge and friendly butchers.\"', ' \"Everything about our night was amazing. The service was personable and professional. The drinks were unique. The food was fresh and the portions were large. If you want a great experience go to Marrow!\"', ' \"This is a great new addition to the Detroit food scene!\\\\nCool atmosphere and incredible servers.\\\\nSuch an interesting variety of choices.\\\\nRice dumplings were outstanding and flavorful.\\\\nBone marrow melts in your mouth.\\\\nOwner made an effort to introduce herself and make sure all was good!\\\\nI will visit again !!\"', ' \"Wow, marrow bone soup...delicious.  Steak truly cooked the right way!\"', ' \"Excellent food, friendly service and even better atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nReservation is recommend specially over the weekend\"', ' \"This is a butcher shop and restaurant. They had one red meat offering at 55 dollars. I do not understand how a shop filled with red meat could only offer one red meat meal.  I kept asking you have a wall full of meat and you only offer one steak at dollars , I do not understand !\"', ' \"I visited Marrow for the first time last night, at the recommendation of a friend.  We started with the Bao and Butter.  The boa buns had a flavorful seasoning and were fluffy and light, almost reminiscent of a soft pretzel crossed with a traditional bao.  They came with a hearty helping of seaweed infused butter.  A delicious warm up to the meal.\\\\nNext up was the Charcuterie.  We had the Pork Rillette and a cheese whose name escapes me which came with a blueberry spread as well as crackers.  The rillete was delicious paired with the blueberry spread, as well as the cheese we selected.\\\\nNext was the Steak Tartare.  This was a different take on tartare than I\\'ve experienced previously.  It was left more chunky than pureed (a big plus to me!) and was infused with citrus and cilantro flavors, and served with a seaweed fortune cookie as it\\'s delivery mechanism.  It is truly the best tartare I have had, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!\\\\nNow, the Roasted Bone Marrow. This was the crown jewel of the night.  A monster piece of bone, filled with delicious marrow, topped with herbs and pickled blueberries.  It was served with pate a choux puffs, which you filled to make a savory puff.  This melt in your mouth explosion of flavor is something you must experience for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and order this dish.\\\\nFinally, we had the Spicy Szechuan Udon Noodles with corned pork tongue.  The tongue was flavorful, tender, and there was ample amounts of it in the dish.  The udon was well cooked and the sauce was just enough spice to build up nicely without being overwhelming.  This dish also included fiddlehead ferns, which I had never had but reminded me of a nicely charred asparagus!\\\\n\\\\nI have nothing but compliments on my meal here! In addition, this 5 dish meal was $100 total, split between two people, which for the quality, thought, and preparation of the meal and knowledgeable server suggestions, is hard to beat.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been looking forward to trying this place since the James Beard semifinalist lists came out and I really wanted to love it. The 3 stars is for the food unfortunately. It\\'s a great concept and and I love that it\\'s located in a transition area and will hopefully bring energy and a bit of cool new Detroit vibe to the area. We liked the ambience and the service was good. Appetizers and smaller plates were good, the bao buns were worth coming back for. But larger plates looked and sounded great but some ultimately just didn\\'t taste great or lacked balance. Corned tongue was pretty good. Shrimp stir fry was pretty good if a bit too salty (a side of plain rice would have made it perfect). Michigan beef special (Brazilian style?) had a lot going on but was just ok. And Bao burger special in particular was almost inedible. It\\'s as if someone came up with the concept but no one actually tasted the dish before selling it to the customers. Beef tasted uncooked even though it was cooked to medium per our request, the bun was salty and had a mouth feel like under-baked dough. Kimchi didn\\'t do anything for the dish except to accentuate the weird taste of the beef. A straight up well grilled burger on a toasted bun would have been a way better way to feature good beef. With the luxury of a good butcher shop on premise, I wish they\\'d focus more on the goodness that is a good piece of seared, caramelized, well salted meat and less on making it so complicated and trendy. I know the menu changes all the time so maybe we went on an off night/week? Will have to give it another try but I\\'m not sure I\\'d run back here given so many other options in Detroit.\"', ' \"Excellent and creative menu. Wine and liquors are from local wineries and distilleries. Options for vegetarians as well.\"', ' \"Amazing addition to the neighborhood! Been a couple times now and have been blown away by the quality of the food and the wine selection! \\\\n\\\\nStarted with a huge charcuterie (the pickled shrimp is so tasty), then moved on to the radicchio salad, tempura delicata squash (phenomenal!), and Mapo Mushrooms. \\\\n\\\\nAll the food is amazing, but the noodles and broth is life changing! The broth is complex and full of flavor topped with a silk smooth duck egg....I\\'ve never had a \\\\\"ramen\\\\\" so tasty!\\\\n\\\\nHad several great desserts and more than a few bottles of wine. \\\\n\\\\nStaff and management are all well seasoned professionals and really know how to treat their guests. :)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck it out, I doubt you\\'ll be disappointed.\"', ' \"Came in last week and sat at the counter for a really indulgent and enjoyable night. Our server was incredibly attentive and thorough, taking the utmost care that my friend\\'s shellfish allergy was accommodated and ensuring that we were totally content all evening, which we certainly were! My companion and I shared a charcuterie board, the roasted cauliflower, the marrow (when in Rome, right?), and a dessert of small donuts that reminded me of a beignet mixed with a churro and a sesame whipped cream. Everything was delectable and intricately finessed, and we had a great experience from top to bottom. So glad to have finally visited!\"', ' \"The food, environment, and ambience are excellent. I love their changing menu salad every time and desserts were also noteworthy. I\\'d like to compliment the staff and owner for their genuine hospitality. It\\'s been a long time since me or my guests have been wowed by a server\\'s excellent attentiveness to detail. Lauren made our night very special and we recommended her to our friends who also recently visited Marrow. They too were blown away. Thanks to the owner, Lauren, and the rest of the staff for making our experiences at Marrow so memorable. Keep up the good work!\"', ' \"I absolutely loved the meal I had here. I can\\'t wait to return. The tartare was fantastic. Every dish was delicious, including the baklava donut dessert. We did not get the tasting menu (we chose to order every dish we wanted individually), but I really appreciated that the waitress told us what would be on the tasting menu since not all places do that. It helped us decide what to do!\"', ' \"Great experience. Really enjoyed everything that I ate. I sat at the bar and chatted up some of the folks. Marrow has a great atmosphere.

On our last visit, we stopped at the butcher counter and picked up some amazing dry aged beef short ribs. So good!\"', ' \"Unique dining experience awaits you!

The fried pork popcorn app is super yum and goes great with cocktails. I didn\\'t love the yakitori it was really fatty but I don\\'t know much about Asian cuisine so it could have been an item not suited for me. I had the scallops and I very much enjoyed all of the flavors. The con on this item for me was that it was room temperature almost cold? I didn\\'t care for where my dinner mate and I were seated we were by the end window in a small table that every waiter kept walking through and it made dinner service a little annoying at times. I also didn\\'t care for how the cheese and meat are ala carte but maybe I overlooked an option where you could pick a combo of three or more, or a make your own board or chefs choice. The desserts were fabulous get the pot of chocolate and ice creams! Overall it was pretty fantastic and all of the flavors were really on point. Hats off to the creator of the menu items and flavor combos. Nice work!\"', ' \"Chefs Selection is a must try so detailed and creative. Each course was absolutely phenomenal and one of my friends had gluten free allergy they immediately accommodated and made separate dishes for her.\\\\n\\\\nGreat food and great service. Will be back.\"', ' \"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious! The location is somewhat surprising based on the surrounding area but the restaurant had a parking lot right next to their building. I had a Bloody Mary that was phenomenal. We split and order of the breakfast dumplings which were unique and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Big bao and I ordered the lamb yakitori scramble and we were both very happy. We ate in the dining room side but I would love to also sit at their beautiful bar. We will definitely be back soon!\"', ' \"This 5 stars is specifically for the brunch. I tried the dumplings (both chorizo and mushroom), the big bao, and the breakfast burger. Everything was phenomenal. This is my second favorite burger in Detroit. I came for dinner a while ago and wasn\\'t very excited about what I had, but I\\'m definitely going to give it another try after such an amazing brunch. Looking forward to coming back!\"', ' \"This place lived up to all that I expected.  The Mull It Over Signature Cocktail was fantastic.  The glutinous rice dumplings were delicious and the fish roe was a delicious addition.  The corned tongue was a wonderful mix of flavors.  The dessert I had was really good.  It was a sundae with three different ice creams with a rich chocolate sauce to pour over all of it. My server at the bar was excellent.  Definitely will be returning in the future.  Thanks to the PBS show Dine and Dish Nation for reviewing this restaurant\"', ' \"This will probably turn into a 5-star review when I\\'m there next. Service can be a bit spotty (long waits, forgotten orders) but waitstaff are friendly.  Marrow, yakitori, congee and bao are great. Tartare is good but please, no potato chips - toast points would be better. The owner keeps a sharp eye on the place (we saw her circulating) which is probably why the food was good. Only misstep was the brussel sprouts which were drowning in an overly sweet gochujang-based sauce - my suggestion would be to do a take on Korean fried cauliflower or stuffed peppers with ground pork. \\\\n\\\\nThe other issue is noise. Too many hard surfaces=deafening levels of noise during peak hours. My NIOSH sound level meter registered an exceedingly high decibel reading which is probably why I would never come here again on the weekends. I know acoustic control is expensive but even some spray-on foams would make a huge difference. \\\\n\\\\nLast but not least, for extra shiok points and to make all of us with fond memories of living in S\\'pore or Malaysia happy: please introduce your  take on laksa, rendang, nasi lemak or bak chor mee onto the menu. I will literally eat at Marrow everyday if you do. Thank you.\"', ' \"A great find!  I\\'ve been here with a small group and the larger dinner group (12).  The Chef Tasting knocks it out of the park.  Meatballs have a nice kick and crunchy topping, lamb kofta with tzadziki AND chimichurri!  Salads to die for (my meat eaters were licking the plate).  Great service, very knowledgeable and personable staff.  You\\'ll have a great dinner, and take home a steak or chop from the butcher shop!\"']\n",

It pains me to write a poor review of Marrow because we had such high expectations for this beautiful restaurant, but neither the food nor the service was very memorable. \\nWe arrived without a reservation and were told there was a 90-minute wait but we could eat at the chef's counter, which we did.  Throughout the evening several of the empty tables remained empty so it appears they are being a little too generous with their time allowance if diners don't show up. \\nAs others have mentioned, the restaurant is beautiful.  They've done a wonderful job with the interior and thankfully made it unique instead of copying the trends that so many other restaurants have followed recently.  (ie. No Edison bulbs)\\nWe started with a couple of draft beers-both nice.  We then notified our server we would be sharing all plates and started with the marrow toast and the dumplings.  Neither were good.  The toast was hard yet very greasy and had little marrow on it.   The dumplings were presented beautifully but had little flavor and were either under cooked or intentionally \\\"doughy\\\" such that they stuck to the roof of your mouth.  Not good at all.  \\nWe then ordered the kimchi Caesar salad and the scallops.  The salad was the star of the show.  Delicious with a perfect dressing that had a hint of Szechuan peppercorns.  The portion was also quite large.  \\nThe scallops were disappointing.  They (3 for $26) were large and perfectly cooked but also had minimal flavor.  The brown butter vinaigrette and peanuts didn't do the scallops justice.  \\nOverall the food was very bland.  Maybe with some tweaking they can get everything right or maybe we just ordered the wrong items in a meat centric restaurant.  \\nThroughout the evening our dirty dishes were not removed until long after the course was complete. Our plates were never replaced.  We had to eat all four courses off the same dirty plates that had sauces from the previous course.  I realize this is a new restaurant but this level of service is not acceptable.  The restaurant is made up of industry veterans and they should know better. In addition, they also include a \\\"Suggested Tip\\\" section at the bottom of the bill which starts at 20% and goes to 25%.  That is a little steep, especially given the level of service provided.  Tacky.  \\nOverall, we left the restaurant very disappointed.  They will receive excellent reviews because the restaurant itself is beautiful, the owner and chef are very well known throughout the city and it's the new trendy place to go.

Such was our experience at Marrow. Our server was friendly and accommodating. She came over and greeted us right away, and took great pains to explain the menu. Her explanation came with a bit of attempted up-selling, but I'm assuming that was part of her training, so I won't hold it against her (much). Decor was nice, but - as we have seen at other trendy restaurants - more could have been done to dampen the ambient noise. As this Yelper's old ears age ever more, we become more sensitive to this issue. It would have been nice to hear the conversation from our co-diner sitting across the table. Next, parking. Nonexistent. No lot, no nearby structure. We managed to snag a spot around the corner on a residential side street. We did worry a bit about the safety of the neighborhood, but all turned out ok. Now, the food.  We went a little crazy with our apps orders, due to the abundance of choices offered on the menu. We got: beet salad (good); charred cauliflower (unexpectedly spicy, server failed to alert us to the large amount of cilantro - problematic for at least 2 of our party); glutinous rice dumplings (very good); toasted marrow (a guilty pleasure - very nice); and Idyll Farms seasonal cheese. This last app (the cheese) was nice. However, it was sliced super- thin, and was served with somewhat fewer crackers than needed - since our server knew we would be sharing the apps, a couple more crackers would not have been too much to ask. And now, the entrees. Our co-diners shared one of the 2 Michigan selections, the ribeye. They seemed to enjoy it.  At $55, one would hope so. Our less expensive selection ($45), the strip, was disappointing. Flavor was fine, but the dish was marred by a tendon running the length of the meat that was impossible to cut through, even with the special steak knives our server made a big deal in presenting to us in a special steak knife box. I struggled so mightily, and with so little success, to cut our steak that the establishment ended up apologizing,removing the steak from our bill, and comping us a couple of desserts. Kudos for the good effort, but sad that it was necessary. Especially in a place that claims to specialize in well-butchered meat. Desserts were: just ok. One was a lemon cornmeal cake with sorbet and blueberries, the other some kind of donut. Not memorable. Can't complain too much, since they were comped. But I don't think I'd order them on a future visit. All in all, would rate the service 4 to 5 stars, the apps very nice, but the entree - not great.\", \"author\": \"Miriam I.\"}]\n",

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now! Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\\\n\\\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We eat all over Detroit and it\\'s a favorite here now.\"', ' \"This is my fourth experience at Marrow. Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar. Everything was top notch!\\\\n\\\\nTo go I got a package of dry aged burgers (which we threw on the grill last night and OMG SO GOOD) a frozen meatloaf (probably my least favorite thing I purchased. It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience. And you know I\\'ll be back for all those market purchases again, too!\"', ' \"Off the beaten path, in a residential area. Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene. I cannot wait to spread the word about this place and come back often to try even more items on their beautifully crafted menu. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL MEAL AND EXPERIENCE, MARROW!\"', ' \"5  for cool venue,happy to see some rejoovenation in this area! The food was amazing. Gets 4 stars based on prices. Elevated, in my opinion. When the area (parking) is a bit cleaned up more then it could be a solid 5.\"', ' \"Marrow may have the best food in Detroit right now. Every dish was executed so well! The service and vibe are perfect. Everything from snacks to dessert was truly delicious. We\\'ll be back for sure.\"', ' \"This was one of 2 must-visit places that our daughter had identified for our first trip to see her in Detroit (just FYI, the other was Selden Standard).  She chose well.  \\\\nThere were three of us, and we shared 5 menu items among us, making for a very satisfying dinner.  We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.  Overall a nice dining experience.  Would try it again, but probably would do the regular menu and be less hungry next time.\"', ' \"New \\\\u0026 Yummy!\\\\nMy friend recommended this place, and she did not disappoint (and neither did Marrow).\\\\nStarter - chorizo dumplings. Chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a bit of cheese - served with sour cream, hot sauce, and corn for dipping/addition.\\\\nSeasonal donut - made in house, crispy outside with a fall apart soft inside. The tiny candied oranges on top really brought this to a 4 star rating. It was a cinnamon sugar donut over a layer of caramel spread.\\\\nMy friend adored her lamb scrambled egg bowl, with the home made English muffin.\\\\nCappuccinos are strong \\\\u0026 the fresh squeezed juice is a bit pricey, but tastes fresh and delish.\\\\nOverall, a happy choice for brunch.\\\\nForewarning - they will not sit you until 10AM, but you can sit at the bar and order a drink while you wait.\"', ' \"Came for brunch and the food here is delicious. We got a Jian bing, Congee and tallow potatoes. Potatoes were bomb, get them. Jian bing was decent--if you like pickles, pickled raddish and pickled cabbage (pickled veggies in general) you\\'ll probably enjoy this. I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies. Overall it was good and we\\'ll probably come back for dinner.\"', ' \"Since I heard about this opening, I really wanted to come. I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal. A hunk of summer sausage though? Absolutely.\"', ' \"Marrow is my happy happy place! The staff of this award winning restaurant keep the vibe down-to-earth--there\\'s nothing stuffy about this fabulous eatery and butcher shop (you MUST try their dry aged beef, bacon, and sausages -- soo good!). The bar experience phenomenal, the food is exceptional, and management takes dietary restrictions VERY seriously. (Really though, have a LOT of dietary restrictions (I follow a Low FODMAP diet, which is gluten free, dairy free, and much more), and my dietary restrictions are never a barrier to the preparation of a delicious meal). The design, set up and decor of the restaurant are straight out of West Elm (in all of the right ways)--makes you want to keep ordering snacks, drinks, and good times!\"', ' \"We came here and had the most wonderful experience we could ever think of. Menu is awesome staff great. So glad  we went and  we will definitely be back so much more to try lol\"', ' \"Marrow is one of the restaurants on the best of 2019 new restaurants. It\\'s a bit hard to review this one, I would actually give it a 3.5, but I\\'m rounded up as that is not an option. \\\\n\\\\nMy two friends and I were not able to make reservations, so we took the risk, and went a little early. We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings. They were terrible enough to send back, something I very early do. We also had a couple salads, both were great, fresh and nice sizes. For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd. The noodles and curry were both meal sizes, the scallops were very light. The menu seems to change frequently, so the items I mentioned may or may not still be on the menu (check the website if you are picky).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a good experience but I\\'m not sure I\\'d go back.\"', ' \"Update: \\\\nThe response I received from Marrow was amazing. They explained the upcharge cost was in fact a mistake and that it truly should have been just a slight up charge. They suggested many ways to try and make it right on their part. If this doesn\\'t speak to the character of this restaurant I don\\'t what does. Thank you for doing what you can to make things right! I can\\'t wait to come back and try Marrow again! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis place was delicious! I had never heard of it, but my boyfriend surprised me with reservations. I highly encourage making a reservation before coming. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat in the dining room and got the family style tasting menu. This was amazing. There were a few things that the chef made us that weren\\'t even on the menu! Two of my favorites were the dumplings and the meatballs. The portions looked small, but man did they add up! I walked out feeling satisfied and full. \\\\nMy only negative about this (and honestly it reflects on the waiter) is that we upgraded to beef instead of pork. Our waiter said it was a slight up-charge, but when we received the bill it was a $50 up charge. To me that is not slight and the waiter should have absolutely said that\\'s how much it was!!! (Update: Marrow reached out and made this right as it was an error). \\\\n\\\\nAlthough this is a butcher shop, there meat selection did seem to be limited. I was expecting a few more meat selections on the menu, but even without that the menu sounded amazing!! \\\\n\\\\nThe owner was there and walking around a lot. She was very nice and did great job interacting with tables throughout the night. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter was ok. He wasn\\'t as attentive as most other wait staff I saw at their tables. He came up a few times to check on us, but most other wait staff seemed to check on their tables a lot.\"', ' \"We loved Marrow! You walk in through the Butcher Shop, which not only has a meat counter and large pieces of meat dry-aging, but also a hip little bar with trendy cocktails where you can get a drink while you wait for your table. After our server walked us through the options on the menu, we opted for the family style chef\\'s selection plus wine pairing.  This turned out to be a great choice because we got to try a lot of different things and didn\\'t have to make any decisions.  Everything was so good, with larger portions than a traditional tasting menu, and well-paced. We did order an additional dish of the Roasted Marrow, because it wasn\\'t part of the Chef\\'s Selections, and come on, the place is called Marrow! We were glad we did, because it was delicious. It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical). We will definitely be back to Marrow- there are still so many delicious things on the menu left to try, plus there\\'s brunch!\"', ' \"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I\\'d do it.  The atmosphere is unparalleled with the butcher shop in the main room of the restaurant. Once we were seated in the dining room, our waiter was prompt in greeting us and telling us about the farm to table style the restaurant runs by. Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!  He also asked us about any allergies or food restrictions which is such a personalized touch, it made the entire thing feel like it was personalized for us. I wasn\\'t totally sure of some of the wine selections and he knew his stuff and how to pair to compliment our meals.  We went with our waiters recommendation to sample the menu with the 7 dishes they chose and brought out in a course style meal.

Bonus there is a lot to park in, which was convenient.\"', ' \"I\\'ve had three amazing experiences at Marrow, trying a variety of foods. Some of my favorites are the pork skin popcorn, dumplings, marrow itself and scallops. Services staff and kitchen put the guest experience first. On my second visit, when the brunch dumplings were sold out, they ended up making dinner dumplings for the table, which was very appreciated. Cocktail list is always on point and you can typically get a reservation, which is a plus.\"', ' \"One the better restaurants around. Went because of some reviews and must say we were very pleased!\\\\nA lot of interesting things on the menu some things I probably would not order. We decide to do the Chef selections and couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\\\nGot a selection of six plates and did an upgrade to try the bone marrow. Noticed some people came in had a plate or two and a cocktail or wine. Had an excellent Rose from Corsica recommend by our server. Not overly pricey we will definitely return.\"', ' \"Best Thing I Ever Ate: Kasekrainer Sausage\\\\n\\\\nI stopped in to give Marrow another try. This time I got the kasekrainer sausage and the Smoked Ham. The Kasekrainer is the best brautwust I\\'ve ever had. The meat had a complex smoky flavor, indicating the use of more than one type of wood. There was a slight bit of spice, giving a pleasant peppery bite. Even better, the sausages were filled with butterkase cheese. \\\\n\\\\nThe Smoked Ham was delightful - Perfectly smoked with a sweet meaty flavor. It made a wonderful croque monsieur sandwich. I would definitely order more than next time I stop by.\"', ' \"The meal I had here last Thursday was one of the best meals of my life. The server was excellent. The bartender was so thoughtful and helpful it was just great. But the meal - the meal! - we ordered all the entrees and shared and they were all - the steak, the lamb, the pork shoulder - beyond delicious. We all left agreeing that it was one of the nicest dinners we had experienced in a long, long time.\"', ' \"What a breath of fresh air in Grosse Pointe. The ambience is new, hip and embraces hipster culture. \\\\nMy husband and I ordered the special which allows you to have samples from different meats and cheeses. I believe it was called the chef\\'s special.  The lamb had to be my favorite because it was cooked perfectly and paired with an amazing sweet jelly. Located conveniently next door is a butcher where you can purchase everything you just ate. I highly recommend this place for date night or for cocktails after work with friends.\"', ' \"Customer service is lacking. I called and specifically asked for an item, I was told they always carry it and didn\\'t need a special order. When I went there to pick it up days later , they didn\\'t have it. Very disappointed.

But all was forgiven once we experienced the food! \\\\n\\\\nRibeye was well worth the upsell. Silky scallops and fluffy meatballs were our favorites! Also loved the terrine. Was almost too full for main course when it arrived!\"', ' \"Great concept. They buy a cow, butcher it inside the restaurant when closed (yes, actually in the dining room), age the meat, then either sell it from the butcher shop or serve it in the restaurant.  Located in an area of town that is still in a transition stage, it took a brave entrepreneur to do this project. And the reward was a James Beard nomination for best new restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance: Very comfortable, bistro-like, trendy, but understated. Great design and build out.\\\\n\\\\nWine list: Owner also owns a wine bar in Detroit so knows her stuff. Too bad her palate and my palate are polar opposites.  Not much on the wine list I like. Wish she would diversify. \\\\n\\\\nService: All trained professional servers, but not over-the-top. Our server was a bit slow and kept disappearing, but it did take away from the experience. \\\\n\\\\nMenu: surprisingly, not very meat-centric.  About half the entr\\\\u00e9es are vegetarian.  Creative and diverse. Charcuterie changes regularly. Prices seem to be extremely reasonable.  \\\\n\\\\nFood: all solid, but with one exception, none of it was like \\\\\"oh my gosh, this is delicious!\\\\\". The House Delicatessen for $7 was three thin slices of homemade salami and some mustard seed.  The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.  Curious to try their steak next time.I\"', ' \"I have been spreading the word about this spot in West Village since I dined here.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a butcher shop restaurant combo located on Kercheval Ave. They have a small parking lot off the side of the building, but also unpaid street parking is available.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is small, so I would highly suggest calling ahead if you have a big group to see if they will make accommodations. \\\\n\\\\nGreat menu selection, with dishes that seemed Asian inspired, I loved everything we ordered. The tartare was great(you\\'ll notice it isn\\'t served with the typical quail egg) except I prefer when they serve the dish with toasted baguette slices opposed to kettle like chips. Loved the cauliflower with the feta and yellow raisins. Also honorable mention: the radish slaw.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I went with the Dry Aged Chef\\'s choice. It was awesome. A NY strip perfectly cooked with a kimchi pancake that accompanied the steak perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAlso on the menu a full charcutrie and cheese option which would be I\\'m sure phenomenal with their wine menu. \\\\n\\\\nThey also serve brunch. Score.\"', ' \"RUN, DON\\'T WALK to their BRUNCH! Dare I say... I think their brunch is a lot better than their dinner. There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses. I\\'ll definitely be coming back and can\\'t wait to try more new dishes as well as some newfavorites :) Bon appetit!\"', ' \"I spent most of my adult career as a traveling sales executive.

This was a hard review to figure out, because one dish we had was AMAZING, but the rest of the meal wasn\\'t as great. Marrow is a small restaurant connected to a butcher shop. We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish.

Good meal, but not a standout among the other meals we had over our Detroit weekend!\"', ' \"What: A neighborhood butcher shop by day and a vibrant restaurant by night.\\\\n\\\\nWhy: While diners are more accustomed to whole-animal butchery and offal now, there are still relatively few cities where a butcher can generate enough business to sustain itself. Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage.

Right by Indian Village in Detroit, this felt a bit off the beaten path and then I realized Craft Work is just a few blocks away and this is a block over from Sister Pie. Almost a hidden gem. \\\\nAs I age, I\\'m becoming hesitant at times to try new places since I\\'m nowhere near hipster. I appreciated that the clientele varied and we were by no means the oldest. \\\\nIf you are a picky eater, or have limitations with your diet, they\\'re wonderfully accommodating. I have a gluten sensitivity but try to not be high maintenance about it. They came up with a solution for everything. \\\\nOur waitress (Quinn) was absolutely fantastic. Thorough in describing the menu and gave us great recommendations. \\\\nWe did start with charcuterie, which is always a personal fave for me. We also had the burrata, which was a little bit of a stretch for us because neither of us care for tomatoes. It was delicious and we even went outside our comfort zones and ate some of the tomatoes. :)\\\\nThe beef choice that evening was an aged New York strip, which my husband chose, while I had one of the pork selections for the evening. I will never be able to accurately remember what came with each but it was unique, flavorful and fun. \\\\nAs if we needed it, we did do two desserts. I can only remember the name of one (ice cream sundae with fun flavors; not your standard) but the second was just scrumptious. It had whipped cream, chocolate ganache and cherries. Enough said. \\\\nOf course we had beer and wine - and their list for either is varied.

My group and I went into dining delirium as we feasted on plate after plate of delectable food.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, it\\'s a butcher shop - so, meat lovers, prepare to indulge. The lamb chops were honestly out of this world - succulent, seasoned, oversized. The memory is making my mouth water. There\\'s a lot of vegetarian options, too.

If you want a vegetarian to know what meat tastes like without breaking their diet- have them order this.\\\\n-Pork belly dish with cherries, cherry compote and fermented mustard seeds.  Probably the best pork belly dish my wife and I ever had.\\\\n-Lamb loin prepared with a yogurt and fermented carrots.  I hate carrots, but when they taste like kimchi- I\\'m all about it.  Lamb was cooked to perfection and practically melted in our mouths.\\\\n-Butterscotch pudding dessert (I forget the french name of the dish).

First of all it\\'s not a super large establishment it\\'s actually what I would classify as the right size for premium service. Upon arriving at Morrow they were quite busy but not too busy for one of the three greeters at the door to greet me with a smile and ask how many would be with our party. They did say there\\'s two open seats at the bar but hold on let me see if we can get you at the chef\\'s table. Sure Nuff next thing you know I\\'m seated at the chef\\'s table looking at a menu that is totally amazing. Where do you start well Robert was there to help make some of the decisions we started with the Glutinous Rice Dumplings with meat filling and local roe upon arrival they looked amazing but the taste was truly incredible after taking the first bite your head and you\\'re body kind of enters a different universe and then after you chew and absorb the flavors and the texture you return back to Earth and say wow I\\'ve got to do that again and guess what with 3 dumplings you get multiple shots at it. Upon finishing the dumplings we ordered the daily steak selection which just happened to be ribeye we also ordered the Cured Scallops with parsnip puree grilled bok choy toasted peanuts and pomegranate.  I really don\\'t want to write a book about our experience at Marrows but let\\'s start with the ribeye the presentation phenomenal, as always in a higher-end restaurant I had the chef cook it to his preference let me tell you it was perfect the condiments that came with the steak were even more outrageous then I could have imagined what an experience dining on such a fine piece of meat graced with wonderful vegetables prepared excellently. The cured scallops where nothing short of marvelous every aspect on the plate was utilized for a flavor profile that cannot be explained on a review on Yelp it would require someone with a much better understanding of the English language to explain how truly marvellous the entire dining experience at Morrow was. Thank you for placing yourself in the city of Detroit for everyone to have an opportunity to dine like royalty, rock stars, and the ultra-elite. If I could give you one piece of advice it would be don\\'t change a thing because you can\\'t perfect perfection.\"', ' \"Great restaurant with a diverse menu full of really tasty selections. Easy parking on the street. Cool decor with several types of seating: communal picnic tables, a bar overlooking the kitchen, and regular tables. They also have a nice outdoor patio. We sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the chefs work. Had a great waitress who was really friendly and took great care of us. The food varies from small appetizers to small entrees, all of them shareable. To avoid too long of review, as we ordered a lot of stuff, I will just say that everything was great!! Tasty and well prepared. The only criticism I would have is that it is kinda pricey for the small servings you get. That\\'s why we ordered a lot of things, that being said, you get what you pay for. I feel it was well worth the price as the food was so good. They also have a meat counter where we took home some of the best bacon I\\'ve ever had (cooked for breakfast the next day). We will definitely be back for the food and that bacon!!!\"', ' \"Marrow knocks it out of the park from ambiance to every food item we tried on the menu. I was impressed by their large drink menu, and the reasonable bottle prices. We started off with a delicious bottle of champagne, but one thing to note is that they don\\'t pour your champagne when you need refills, which is surprising for a $100+ pp restaurant. We started with squash blossoms and a meat and cheese mini board, both extremely fresh and delicious. For our main, we chose the market steak (NY Strip $50) and Nick\\'s pick which was an italian sausage with a corn butter medley. If you have the opportunity to order sausage, which we had for both the board and a main, GET IT! It was seriously amazing both hot and cold. Finally, we wrapped it up with the Strawberry Shortcake. Order that one too, the strawberry ice cream and two biscuits were just incredible. Yes, this place is expensive, but yes it is worth it.\"', ' \"I have dined here twice since it opened, and I have to say, both were amazing experiences. It is a very small restaurant with a butcher shop and cocktail bar near the entry. They also have seating next to their kitchen, so you can watch your food being prepared from when it\\'s ordered to when it is expoed out to you. \\\\nThey have a rotating menu, so you never have to try the same thing twice! One of my favorites that seems to be a keeper on their menu is the pickled shrimp; there is a great balance of the bright pickle with a sweet corn butter and fresh toast. Absolutely phenomenal. \\\\n\\\\nNow, on my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I had truly one of the best experiences of service I\\'ve ever had. I, sadly, don\\'t recall his name, but our waiter had very detailed and accurate descriptors for each dish, wonderfully calm mannerisms, and perfectly balanced being present at the table and giving us space to enjoy the experience. A few of the highlights of our most recent visit was the firecracker shrimp, dry aged house beef with sunchokes and horseradish creme fresh, and the Brussel sprouts.

I talked to the hostess Kate and assured me that our reservation was all set for later that day.  Then she said, your anniversary huh, I\\'m going to set you at my Favorite Table, which turned out to be perfect.  Our waitress that night was really great, she explained the menu, We ordered some stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer along with a couple of craft beers.  For dinner we went with two of their specials for the day, some super tasty Lamb Chops and a Beef Tenderloin that not only was extremely tender but honestly rates up as one of my two top favorite steaks I have ever eaten and the other one was The Chicago Chop House in Chicago 25 years ago.  This is a small, quaint place with some outstanding food.  Bonus that they are also a butcher shop with prime beef, pork, specialty sausages, lunch meats and more that you can purchase to take home or as we learned, pick an item and have the waitress ask the chef as to how they will prepare it for you right there.  This is a Great Place for any special day.\"', ' \"Went on a wintry week night, so the place was very low key.  Which was nice, because I had to unexpectedly bump the rezzies at the last minute.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the vibe:  very gentrified.  Our server was training someone who usually worked the brunch shift.  When I ordered an old-fashioned, they even checked with the bartender to make a recommendation.  Both knew the menu pretty well, but faltered when asked exactly WHERE the local beef came from...it\\'s Detroit, after all, and you don\\'t exactly see cows out to pasture...\\\\n\\\\nThey asked about food allergies and worked closely with the chef to figure out dishes that might have coconut.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several dishes.

The food was tasty. We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\"', ' \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\\\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn\\'t miss the fact that there wasn\\'t any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I\\'ve had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I\\'ll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can\\'t complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\\\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn\\'t season the steak, which I guess they didn\\'t need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\\\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don\\'t mind, but if you\\'re a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\\\n\\\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I\\'m honestly not sure if I just don\\'t really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I\\'d come often at all. But food was DELISH. Ambiance was kind of romantic with soft lighting.\"', ' \"Phenomenal! We went here for my husbands birthday and this place did not disappoint. We started with the rice dumplings. I cannot explain how wonderful these dumplings were! For dinner we had their two specials: one was cassoulet with a French style sausage (the real winner was the pieces of French baguette they had with it) and a picanha (top sirloin steak) with kimchi and sunflower roots. I honestly don\\'t think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food, staff, and overall atmosphere were just perfect. Can\\'t wait to come back and try the family style chef\\'s menu!\"', ' \"I really enjoyed my dinner here and so did my 4 companions. We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\\\n\\\\nBecause it\\'s the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don\\'t have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\\\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they\\'re offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\\\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu. Plus I think I want to come back and buy some meat from the butcher side - looked at a few things as I was leaving and thought the quality and price looked great.\"', ' \"Excellent food, Excellent service, and great atmosphere.

This is a very expensive dining experience - for foodies the value may be there but I\\'m no longer a foodie and I\\'m now the type who realizes I could have  purchased a couple of nice pieces of clothing for the price of my dinner.

They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\\\"nice\\\\\" restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn\\'t even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I\\'ve never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to. This place and some of their staff definitely came off to me like they were \\\\\"trying too hard\\\\\" and soberly striving to reach some \\\\\"it factor\\\\\" of culinary coolness. I\\'m getting too old for that nonsense.\"', ' \"Oh my.  Determined to dine in West Village, the four of us descended upon Marrow last night.  We all had the chef\\'s menu...7-8 courses with each one fantastic.  The chef adjusted on the fly and added a tenderloin for my daughter (grilled perfectly).  My guess is that everything on the menu is fantastic, but do yourself a favor and have their scallops.  They\\'re grilled on a sort of wood box grill that adds the perfect touch of smokiness to the dish.  From Anchorage to Seattle to New York to LA, Marrow has the best scallops I\\'ve ever had.  Lastly, our server was fantastic, fun and engaging.  Can\\'t wait to go back.\"', ' \"Super impressed with this place. Went there and got the tasting menu. At first I was nervous because the portions were on the smaller side but there was so much food that came out I left stuffed. I highly recommend trying this place and doing the tasting menu. It was relatively inexpensive for a steakhouse and worth every penny.\"', ' \"Marrow was an absolutely wonderful experience. From decor, to flow of the restaurant, service, and the main star of the evening the food. We started with the charcuterie which was full of flavor, followed by the marrow toast which was a delight. Next had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, followed by the \\\\\"From the Butchers Case\\\\\" which was lamb kafta. The lamb was wonderfully cooked and tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend this restaurant.\"', ' \"Wow.  Yum.  Each dish was exceptional and unique.  The restaurant is lovely with a great staff.  Everyone was wonderful but our server Stephanie was amazing and made the night extra special. Will be back and also try the butcher shop.\"', ' \"Disappointing. Another go starving and leave hungry eatery. No hearty beef dishes on menu despite walking by the impressive aging display, meats In deli counter.  Skimpy expensive portions. Service was good. Cool digs not enough to warrant a return visit.\"', ' \"We celebrated our first year anniversary last night and couldn\\'t be happier with the service/food. Marrow is definitely worth checking out!\"', ' \"Great brunch spot and good cocktails.  Butcher counter is the best in the city.  Great little patio in the summer.  Knowledge and friendly butchers.\"', ' \"Everything about our night was amazing. The service was personable and professional. The drinks were unique. The food was fresh and the portions were large. If you want a great experience go to Marrow!\"', ' \"This is a great new addition to the Detroit food scene!\\\\nCool atmosphere and incredible servers.\\\\nSuch an interesting variety of choices.\\\\nRice dumplings were outstanding and flavorful.\\\\nBone marrow melts in your mouth.\\\\nOwner made an effort to introduce herself and make sure all was good!\\\\nI will visit again !!\"', ' \"Wow, marrow bone soup...delicious.  Steak truly cooked the right way!\"', ' \"Excellent food, friendly service and even better atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nReservation is recommend specially over the weekend\"', ' \"This is a butcher shop and restaurant. They had one red meat offering at 55 dollars. I do not understand how a shop filled with red meat could only offer one red meat meal.  I kept asking you have a wall full of meat and you only offer one steak at dollars , I do not understand !\"', ' \"I visited Marrow for the first time last night, at the recommendation of a friend.  We started with the Bao and Butter.  The boa buns had a flavorful seasoning and were fluffy and light, almost reminiscent of a soft pretzel crossed with a traditional bao.  They came with a hearty helping of seaweed infused butter.  A delicious warm up to the meal.\\\\nNext up was the Charcuterie.  We had the Pork Rillette and a cheese whose name escapes me which came with a blueberry spread as well as crackers.  The rillete was delicious paired with the blueberry spread, as well as the cheese we selected.\\\\nNext was the Steak Tartare.  This was a different take on tartare than I\\'ve experienced previously.  It was left more chunky than pureed (a big plus to me!) and was infused with citrus and cilantro flavors, and served with a seaweed fortune cookie as it\\'s delivery mechanism.  It is truly the best tartare I have had, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!\\\\nNow, the Roasted Bone Marrow. This was the crown jewel of the night.  A monster piece of bone, filled with delicious marrow, topped with herbs and pickled blueberries.  It was served with pate a choux puffs, which you filled to make a savory puff.  This melt in your mouth explosion of flavor is something you must experience for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and order this dish.\\\\nFinally, we had the Spicy Szechuan Udon Noodles with corned pork tongue.  The tongue was flavorful, tender, and there was ample amounts of it in the dish.  The udon was well cooked and the sauce was just enough spice to build up nicely without being overwhelming.  This dish also included fiddlehead ferns, which I had never had but reminded me of a nicely charred asparagus!\\\\n\\\\nI have nothing but compliments on my meal here! In addition, this 5 dish meal was $100 total, split between two people, which for the quality, thought, and preparation of the meal and knowledgeable server suggestions, is hard to beat.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been looking forward to trying this place since the James Beard semifinalist lists came out and I really wanted to love it. The 3 stars is for the food unfortunately. It\\'s a great concept and and I love that it\\'s located in a transition area and will hopefully bring energy and a bit of cool new Detroit vibe to the area. We liked the ambience and the service was good. Appetizers and smaller plates were good, the bao buns were worth coming back for. But larger plates looked and sounded great but some ultimately just didn\\'t taste great or lacked balance. Corned tongue was pretty good. Shrimp stir fry was pretty good if a bit too salty (a side of plain rice would have made it perfect). Michigan beef special (Brazilian style?) had a lot going on but was just ok. And Bao burger special in particular was almost inedible. It\\'s as if someone came up with the concept but no one actually tasted the dish before selling it to the customers. Beef tasted uncooked even though it was cooked to medium per our request, the bun was salty and had a mouth feel like under-baked dough. Kimchi didn\\'t do anything for the dish except to accentuate the weird taste of the beef. A straight up well grilled burger on a toasted bun would have been a way better way to feature good beef. With the luxury of a good butcher shop on premise, I wish they\\'d focus more on the goodness that is a good piece of seared, caramelized, well salted meat and less on making it so complicated and trendy. I know the menu changes all the time so maybe we went on an off night/week? Will have to give it another try but I\\'m not sure I\\'d run back here given so many other options in Detroit.\"', ' \"Excellent and creative menu. Wine and liquors are from local wineries and distilleries. Options for vegetarians as well.\"', ' \"Amazing addition to the neighborhood! Been a couple times now and have been blown away by the quality of the food and the wine selection! \\\\n\\\\nStarted with a huge charcuterie (the pickled shrimp is so tasty), then moved on to the radicchio salad, tempura delicata squash (phenomenal!), and Mapo Mushrooms. \\\\n\\\\nAll the food is amazing, but the noodles and broth is life changing! The broth is complex and full of flavor topped with a silk smooth duck egg....I\\'ve never had a \\\\\"ramen\\\\\" so tasty!\\\\n\\\\nHad several great desserts and more than a few bottles of wine. \\\\n\\\\nStaff and management are all well seasoned professionals and really know how to treat their guests. :)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck it out, I doubt you\\'ll be disappointed.\"', ' \"Came in last week and sat at the counter for a really indulgent and enjoyable night. Our server was incredibly attentive and thorough, taking the utmost care that my friend\\'s shellfish allergy was accommodated and ensuring that we were totally content all evening, which we certainly were! My companion and I shared a charcuterie board, the roasted cauliflower, the marrow (when in Rome, right?), and a dessert of small donuts that reminded me of a beignet mixed with a churro and a sesame whipped cream. Everything was delectable and intricately finessed, and we had a great experience from top to bottom. So glad to have finally visited!\"', ' \"The food, environment, and ambience are excellent. I love their changing menu salad every time and desserts were also noteworthy. I\\'d like to compliment the staff and owner for their genuine hospitality. It\\'s been a long time since me or my guests have been wowed by a server\\'s excellent attentiveness to detail. Lauren made our night very special and we recommended her to our friends who also recently visited Marrow. They too were blown away. Thanks to the owner, Lauren, and the rest of the staff for making our experiences at Marrow so memorable. Keep up the good work!\"', ' \"I absolutely loved the meal I had here. I can\\'t wait to return. The tartare was fantastic. Every dish was delicious, including the baklava donut dessert. We did not get the tasting menu (we chose to order every dish we wanted individually), but I really appreciated that the waitress told us what would be on the tasting menu since not all places do that. It helped us decide what to do!\"', ' \"Great experience. Really enjoyed everything that I ate. I sat at the bar and chatted up some of the folks. Marrow has a great atmosphere. The restaurant is beautiful and everyone who works there is super friendly. \\\\n\\\\nI had the Red Curry entr\\\\u00e9e. It was divine.\"', ' \"Marrow is a neighborhood bar and what a treat it is! Ping and her team have done amazing job of making a neighborhood bar and butcher a chic, fabulous place to have a cocktail, meet friends and entertain clients.\"', ' \"Get there early if you are looking for something specific at the butcher shop. I just had my filet and it was amazing! Can\\'t wait to eat there.\"', ' \"Marrow has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Detroit. The menu is smart and offers something for everyone. The tasting menu is a favorite, offering a wonderful sampling of the chef\\'s talents. At $50, it is a steal! Cocktails are fun and the wine list is lovely. On our last visit, we stopped at the butcher counter and picked up some amazing dry aged beef short ribs. So good!\"', ' \"Unique dining experience awaits you!  I was recommended to this spot as a restaurant and found out it also offers some great items to take home from its market section. Have recommended it to many already. Can\\'t wait to return. Dinner was delicious.\"', ' \"Sunday early afternoon, unexpected find and treat! Kind, quick service.  Fresh atmosphere. Excellent variety within a small menu. I chose healthy vegetarian options and was pleasantly surprised of the food packed with flavor!\"', ' \"Butcher is amazing. I ordered a custom picnic ham for Easter and Nick and Chris were great and made it seamless and it was delicious. The food in general is amazing and a great place for a date or a glass of wine.\"', ' \"Wow what a great place! Love the concept. The fried pork popcorn app is super yum and goes great with cocktails. I didn\\'t love the yakitori it was really fatty but I don\\'t know much about Asian cuisine so it could have been an item not suited for me. I had the scallops and I very much enjoyed all of the flavors. The con on this item for me was that it was room temperature almost cold? I didn\\'t care for where my dinner mate and I were seated we were by the end window in a small table that every waiter kept walking through and it made dinner service a little annoying at times. I also didn\\'t care for how the cheese and meat are ala carte but maybe I overlooked an option where you could pick a combo of three or more, or a make your own board or chefs choice. The desserts were fabulous get the pot of chocolate and ice creams! Overall it was pretty fantastic and all of the flavors were really on point. Hats off to the creator of the menu items and flavor combos. Nice work!\"', ' \"Chefs Selection is a must try so detailed and creative. Each course was absolutely phenomenal and one of my friends had gluten free allergy they immediately accommodated and made separate dishes for her.\\\\n\\\\nGreat food and great service. Will be back.\"', ' \"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious! The location is somewhat surprising based on the surrounding area but the restaurant had a parking lot right next to their building. I had a Bloody Mary that was phenomenal. We split and order of the breakfast dumplings which were unique and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Big bao and I ordered the lamb yakitori scramble and we were both very happy. We ate in the dining room side but I would love to also sit at their beautiful bar. We will definitely be back soon!\"', ' \"This 5 stars is specifically for the brunch. I tried the dumplings (both chorizo and mushroom), the big bao, and the breakfast burger. Everything was phenomenal. This is my second favorite burger in Detroit. I came for dinner a while ago and wasn\\'t very excited about what I had, but I\\'m definitely going to give it another try after such an amazing brunch. Looking forward to coming back!\"', ' \"This place lived up to all that I expected.  The Mull It Over Signature Cocktail was fantastic.  The glutinous rice dumplings were delicious and the fish roe was a delicious addition.  The corned tongue was a wonderful mix of flavors.  The dessert I had was really good.  It was a sundae with three different ice creams with a rich chocolate sauce to pour over all of it. My server at the bar was excellent.  Definitely will be returning in the future.  Thanks to the PBS show Dine and Dish Nation for reviewing this restaurant\"', ' \"This will probably turn into a 5-star review when I\\'m there next. Service can be a bit spotty (long waits, forgotten orders) but waitstaff are friendly.  Marrow, yakitori, congee and bao are great. Tartare is good but please, no potato chips - toast points would be better. The owner keeps a sharp eye on the place (we saw her circulating) which is probably why the food was good. Only misstep was the brussel sprouts which were drowning in an overly sweet gochujang-based sauce - my suggestion would be to do a take on Korean fried cauliflower or stuffed peppers with ground pork. \\\\n\\\\nThe other issue is noise. Too many hard surfaces=deafening levels of noise during peak hours. My NIOSH sound level meter registered an exceedingly high decibel reading which is probably why I would never come here again on the weekends. I know acoustic control is expensive but even some spray-on foams would make a huge difference. \\\\n\\\\nLast but not least, for extra shiok points and to make all of us with fond memories of living in S\\'pore or Malaysia happy: please introduce your  take on laksa, rendang, nasi lemak or bak chor mee onto the menu. I will literally eat at Marrow everyday if you do. Thank you.\"', ' \"A great find!  I\\'ve been here with a small group and the larger dinner group (12).  The Chef Tasting knocks it out of the park.  Meatballs have a nice kick and crunchy topping, lamb kofta with tzadziki AND chimichurri!  Salads to die for (my meat eaters were licking the plate).  Great service, very knowledgeable and personable staff.  You\\'ll have a great dinner, and take home a steak or chop from the butcher shop!\"', ' \"This was one of the best meals I have ever had (and I\\'m a very picky about where I eat and don\\'t give out great reviews willy-nily)!  We tried the tasting menu and it was truly outstanding!  Will return many times.\"', ' \"The food is delightful. The service was not. After reading the Facebook reviews and hearing from friends to try this place I had to. But it was not what I had expected.\"', ' \"I love red meat, and this place is amazing. We had a reservation, and upon arrival were seated promptly. The service throughout the entire meal was superb, and the place was packed considering it was the Saturday before New Year\\'s eve. We ordered the Chef\\'s menu plus a few add-ons, and we completely stuffed by the time the meal was over. Our waitress Lauren was phenomenal.  Not only was she attentive, funny, and quick, she was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu and the wine/spirit list. She made sure we understood exactly what we were getting into regarding the Chef\\'s menu.  This restaurant was also asked about food allergies, and was accommodating when I couldn\\'t have some of the times on the Chef\\'s tasting menu. They Lauren easily substituted items that she felt would go well with that day\\'s menu. \\\\n\\\\nI was extremely nervous about getting the beef marrow and the beef heart dishes, but they were cooked so well and tasted so good, I am an absolute convert!! I cannot wait to go back and explore more of the menu. I would like to say that they noticed that they forgot to give us one of the entrees (there are four in the chef\\'s menu), we hadn\\'t noticed but they brought it to our attention, and made it right. They gave us a gift certificate for when we return, plus an extra dessert to go.   Finally a restaurant in Detroit that not only has amazing food but superb service that is expected when a dinner for two costs over $200. I cannot wait to return!\"', ' \"My friends and I live in the West Village and have tried and tried and TRIED with Marrow. We have come for dinner, neighborhood drinks, buying meat and bones and we have had enough with the crazy bad service. Tonight as usual, the hostess didn\\'t acknowledge us when we walked in, she was reading a book and on her phone and looked truly inconvenienced to help us. So we just walked around the restaurant aimlessly until we had to walk back and inconvenience her to help us. This has happened several times, where the hostess has failed to even say hello, let alone try to service us. I\\'m not sure why someone is being employed to read a book and disregard patrons. The host is the face of the restaurant and we can\\'t continue to spend the amount of money that Marrow charges to feel invisible. We would love to have a neighborhood hang out spot where we feel welcome each time we go. Please please hire amazing people to represent your restaurant and hospitality philosophy.\"', ' \"Good food and expanding menu.\\\\nI enjoy their sandwiches!\\\\nConveniently located as well.\"', ' \"Awesome place, great staff, tasty small plates. The standouts being the bone marrow, pork bao, beef tartare and corned tongue- basically everything we ordered.\"', ' \"Great dinner experience for two! Tasting menu was a great way to sample the menu from starters to dessert. Lamb meatballs were our favorite. We added beef tartar which was really good too. Most dishes had hints of spice. Would return for the steaks.\"', ' \"Had lunch Saturday, group of 5 so able to sample many dishes. Firstly the space is bright comfortable and fresh. Waitstaff is extremely educated and knowledgeable about what they serve, so no unexpected surprises. We had almost the entire brunch menu. This restaurant is not just for serious carnivores. Great vegetarian/gluten and anything else free friendly menu. All dishes were prepared and presented well. Really a great assortment of tastes, textures and flavors.  Ok we all loved it. Thanks!\"', ' \"Disappointing.   It pains me to write a poor review of Marrow because we had such high expectations for this beautiful restaurant, but neither the food nor the service was very memorable. \\\\nWe arrived without a reservation and were told there was a 90-minute wait but we could eat at the chef\\'s counter, which we did.  Throughout the evening several of the empty tables remained empty so it appears they are being a little too generous with their time allowance if diners don\\'t show up. \\\\nAs others have mentioned, the restaurant is beautiful.  They\\'ve done a wonderful job with the interior and thankfully made it unique instead of copying the trends that so many other restaurants have followed recently.  (ie. No Edison bulbs)\\\\nWe started with a couple of draft beers-both nice.  We then notified our server we would be sharing all plates and started with the marrow toast and the dumplings.  Neither were good.  The toast was hard yet very greasy and had little marrow on it.   The dumplings were presented beautifully but had little flavor and were either under cooked or intentionally \\\\\"doughy\\\\\" such that they stuck to the roof of your mouth.  Not good at all.  \\\\nWe then ordered the kimchi Caesar salad and the scallops.  The salad was the star of the show.  Delicious with a perfect dressing that had a hint of Szechuan peppercorns.  The portion was also quite large.  \\\\nThe scallops were disappointing.  They (3 for $26) were large and perfectly cooked but also had minimal flavor.  The brown butter vinaigrette and peanuts didn\\'t do the scallops justice.  \\\\nOverall the food was very bland.  Maybe with some tweaking they can get everything right or maybe we just ordered the wrong items in a meat centric restaurant.  \\\\nThroughout the evening our dirty dishes were not removed until long after the course was complete. Our plates were never replaced.  We had to eat all four courses off the same dirty plates that had sauces from the previous course.  I realize this is a new restaurant but this level of service is not acceptable.  The restaurant is made up of industry veterans and they should know better. In addition, they also include a \\\\\"Suggested Tip\\\\\" section at the bottom of the bill which starts at 20% and goes to 25%.  That is a little steep, especially given the level of service provided.  Tacky.  \\\\nOverall, we left the restaurant very disappointed.  They will receive excellent reviews because the restaurant itself is beautiful, the owner and chef are very well known throughout the city and it\\'s the new trendy place to go.  Ultimately, they will need to improve the food.  Given that Yelp considers two stars to mean \\\\\"I\\'ve had better\\\\\", that is what they will receive.\"', ' \"Meat lovers, this place is for you. A few doors down from Sister Pie, Marrow is not only a restaurant but also a butcher shop. Ping Ho (the founder) did an amazing job meshing the two together. The interior is modern, chic, yet warm and inviting - I love the posters on the wall in particular. They also have outdoor seating, but it was a bit rainy when I went so we opted to sit inside. The menu is quite unique and is a combination of creating your own charcuterie, small plates and some larger entrees. We tried the Beef Yakitori, House Tartare, Noodles and Broth (they have stuff for vegetarians as well!), and the special which was lamb. For drinks, I had a glass of the Kepos di Ampelela and my friend had the Calypso\\'s Cup. The cocktail was very refreshing and my red was perfect. The standouts for me were definitely the Yakitori (I could\\'ve had 10 more sticks..seriously) and the tartare was delish as well. We finished everything up to the last crumb! I need to come back and try more of the menu. Also, must add that everyone was super nice and sweet and the atmosphere is perfect whether you\\'re on a date or just getting together with friends. P.S. if you want broth to go or some of the other items they serve, they have it available for you to buy!\"', ' \"We live in West Village, been stalking the building for over a year.  Waiting patiently for it to open. On Tuesday we stopped by and were greeted with great enthusfrom the host. We perused the menu and at the first, I thought maybe just drinks because the choices were different ingredients. To my dismay the host confirmed the Caesar salad should be my first choice.  My guy ordered the lamb and we both enjoyed our selection.  It is not the place if you are starving as the portions are European portions, but a nice atmosphere. I definitely will return!\"', ' \"Just delicious. Even as a vegetarian!! The pot au creme was to die for. And the lamb and the service and the ambience.\"', ' \"Stopped in last night on the chance we could get a cocktail and some appetizers...all I can say is WOW! It was wonderful.  The service was outstanding, the cocktails were thoughtfully recommended and very tasty and the appetizers were very good! It was a wonderful evening and we left with a great piece of steak for tonight\\'s dinner!\"', ' \"If you\\'re looking for a restaurant that truly does excellent farm to table look no further.  Executive Chef/ Partner, Sara Welch, really conducts a flavor symphony with her food offerings  in this place.   We had the Chef Taste menu option and were not disappointed at all.  From the Glutinous Rice dumplings filled with spices and beef that put my taste buds in a frenzy, to the Charcoal grilled Yakitori Prawns.  Sara truly makes music with her food and I\\'m glad we had the chance to witness this performance first hand.  She is truly an ace at her craft.  Our waitress, Stephi was extraordinary in her knowledge of the menu and what\\'s to be expected of what we ordered.  Truly a great dining experience to be had in the West Village of Detroit.  Owner Ping Ho, has done herself proud by combining such a great team to deliver sustainable food to the Detroit area. We are truly blessed to have this gem of a restaurant in our vicinity.  I will be back to explore the butcher shop and market this place doubles as by day as well.  All in all, go here, if you enjoy great tasting food with flavor combinations that will blow your expectations and taste buds away.  You won\\'t be disappointed .\"', ' \"What an amazing addition to West Village and the Detroit restaurant scene.  We didn\\'t have reservation, so we sat at the bar.  Great and comfortable d\\\\u00e9cor throughout.  Staff very friendly and very knowledgeable.  Our bartender Andrek knew and explained the menu items as if he were cooking.

Stephanie rocked it\"', ' \"The appetizers were the stars of the dinner. The pickled shrimp and pumpkin curry left me wanting more (in a good way). 3 out of 4 of us had steak for our main and while the steak was tasty it had way to much going on in terms of accoutrements and it was already sliced (I like to cut my own). The toppings were good but I wish they came on the side and now that I know next time I will ask. The owner and butcher were very welcoming and you could feel the excitement in the air. It\\'s a nice addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to my next visit...accoutrements on the side.\"', ' \"This is an amazing farm to table restaurant with custom craft cocktails.   Food is amazing.   Organic bacon buy it take it home and cook it!   You won\\'t regret it!\"', ' \"When the reason you come to a restaurant turns out to be the biggest disappointment of your visit, it\\'s hard to rate the restaurant with high marks. Such was our experience at Marrow. Our server was friendly and accommodating. She came over and greeted us right away, and took great pains to explain the menu. Her explanation came with a bit of attempted up-selling, but I\\'m assuming that was part of her training, so I won\\'t hold it against her (much). Decor was nice, but - as we have seen at other trendy restaurants - more could have been done to dampen the ambient noise. As this Yelper\\'s old ears age ever more, we become more sensitive to this issue. It would have been nice to hear the conversation from our co-diner sitting across the table. Next, parking. Nonexistent. No lot, no nearby structure. We managed to snag a spot around the corner on a residential side street. We did worry a bit about the safety of the neighborhood, but all turned out ok. Now, the food.  We went a little crazy with our apps orders, due to the abundance of choices offered on the menu. We got: beet salad (good); charred cauliflower (unexpectedly spicy, server failed to alert us to the large amount of cilantro - problematic for at least 2 of our party); glutinous rice dumplings (very good); toasted marrow (a guilty pleasure - very nice); and Idyll Farms seasonal cheese. This last app (the cheese) was nice. However, it was sliced super- thin, and was served with somewhat fewer crackers than needed - since our server knew we would be sharing the apps, a couple more crackers would not have been too much to ask. And now, the entrees. Our co-diners shared one of the 2 Michigan selections, the ribeye. They seemed to enjoy it.  At $55, one would hope so. Our less expensive selection ($45), the strip, was disappointing. Flavor was fine, but the dish was marred by a tendon running the length of the meat that was impossible to cut through, even with the special steak knives our server made a big deal in presenting to us in a special steak knife box. I struggled so mightily, and with so little success, to cut our steak that the establishment ended up apologizing,removing the steak from our bill, and comping us a couple of desserts. Kudos for the good effort, but sad that it was necessary. Especially in a place that claims to specialize in well-butchered meat. Desserts were: just ok. One was a lemon cornmeal cake with sorbet and blueberries, the other some kind of donut. Not memorable. Can\\'t complain too much, since they were comped. But I don\\'t think I\\'d order them on a future visit. All in all, would rate the service 4 to 5 stars, the apps very nice, but the entree - not great.\"']\n",

I really enjoy the ambiance and decor selection; seems more comfortable than trying to impress. \\nWhere they do impress however is in the menu! It's well balanced with good  variety and selection. The charcuterie portion of the menu does seem impressive however I did not go with any of those or the snacks on this day.

I highly recommend if you are a Marrow virgin like we were to go for the tasting menu. Uuuuunnnnbbbbeeellllliiiiieeevvvvaaaabbbbllllleee. We sat at the chefs table which was so much fun. We had the honor to watch all the magic happen. We also had the honor of sitting right next to the sous chef Phoebe, who educated us, guided us and was part of our unbelievable experience.What a beautiful person she is.  As was Stephanie who was our culinary representative (I don't believe a waiter/waitress/server is a great title anymore. A culinary representative is much more descriptive of what they do and know!) and did a fabulous job recommending a yummy cocktail and the tasting menu. She was sweet, made sure we were OK and approached the evening with a big beautiful smile! We watched Annika in the kitchen and Emma too and they were both so sweet and pumped out some amazing food, again with big smiles. We really felt like we were a part of the preparation process. Actually everyone that is a part of this team had smiles on their faces. I told Phoebe this was the most Zen restaurant I have experienced. There was no yelling (in the kitchen) the staff all really respectful of one another, no side eyes and NO ATTITUDES! WOW even if the food wasn't amazing I would go back just to experience the well oiled machine they have going on. OK the FOOD? The FOOD I really can't say enough about the FOOD. Since we did the tasting menu we were able to try so many different dishes. The scallops.....I don't even like scallops and I would have eaten a dozen. (do you order scallops by the dozen? I don't know but I certainly would have! lol) The rice dumplings; so so good, Citrus radish slaw....light, hint of mint, crunch and wonderful. OH...who needs to wait for a cider mill donut? Not me when I can have a slice of kabocha squash dipped in tempura and given a very hot oil bath dolloped with chutney, cheese OK just try it! Last night the meat offering was a lamb kofta! So flavorful with yummy potatoes with a herby mix and a tzatziki sauce. There was more; the food just kept coming! It sadly had to end but not without a bang of sour cream ice cream with a little almond soft cookie/cakey madeline looking piece of deliciousness! Amazing the whole experience. So many restaurants have great food, or great people, or a great ambiance but very few are able to do it all great; Marrow does! I enjoy great food with a friendly team behind it and that is why I loved this experience at Marrow. Thanks you to the Marrow team! You all should be so proud!

      " [' \"My second favorite restaurant in Detroit. Granted I dont live here, but I could only imagine using their butcher shop for special occasions or parties. The restaurant is a lovely showcase of the meats they sell from the shop. I went with the tasting menu, because I would be stupid not to! \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb yakitori was bomb! The lamb itself made its entrance known with a bold, gamey taste. The labneh was the backup dancer that ended dancing side by side the lamb. The fermented chili taste gave a sweet spicy tangy kick of action. The fried herbs were a delight and surprise that i wish i would see more of! The golden raisins were. Lovely, sweet contrast to everything that added an extra dimension\\\\n\\\\nGouda melted on top of a beef meatball on a bed of squash ricotta with carrots, fried parmesan, and fried rosemary. Damn it was good. What easily could have been Indian, Mediterrenean, or even French, ends up being this earthy, sweet journey through the midwest. The theme of yellow and orange brings warm bright feels during the dead of winter. The gouda was workhorse, holding up the already beefy meatball. The squash ricotta was the marvel of this meal, being unique yet easily interchangeable with any other orange root vegetable.\\\\n\\\\nBeef and mushroom dumpling, fried in beef tallow, with daikon radish scallions and whitefish roe. This one felt a polish midwesterner showing a japanese exchange student how to make perogies but ended up making a dumpling instead. Every ingredient I mentioned stands out accordingly, it ends up being a delightful appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe tallow fried brussel sprouts, with a soft boiled egg and togarashi was straight confort food. What sounds like a dish that would alienate grandma ends up tasting like something she would have made! The egg and beef tallow provided the rich meat flavor while the brussel sprouts provide these bulk of the body. The togarashi engulfs the meal, yet allows the dish to breathe like a sheer cloth draped over a naked body. \\\\n\\\\nThe lamb kofta with fermented vegetables and coconut yogurt seemed as if it would be overwhelming, but it wasn\\'t. If anything, everything was just a mild tang that gracefully lifted the well seasoned kofta. It ended up tasting like something that could be found at a family dinner table, but much more elegant in the details. \\\\n\\\\nThe lemon ice cream here is divine. Super creamy, plenty of full body lemon flavor, and a wonderful texture.\\\\n\\\\nThe baklava donut was base satisfying, but not something that will wow you in its architecture. Although it\\'s not overly sweet, it\\'s definitely more than European sweet. You end up with a fairly big portion that was meant for two people. Make sure to get it a la mode with the cinnamon ice cream preferably. The baklava was more like a bowed out palmier, but it still worked texture wise.\"', ' \"Good food every time I\\'ve gone. There was only one disappointing dish... It was the tongue, and mostly because it was dry and over cooked. I love a good tongue dish. Anything else I\\'ve tried has been spot on.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak tartar was great, charcuterie delicious, entrees really well done.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been to Marrow for brunch, dinner \\\\u0026 a meat stock up now! Our dinner experience was so incredible that I likened it to my experience at Cochon in New Orleans because it was so flavorful but well-balanced. \\\\n\\\\nThe wine selection is really unique because the owner also owns The Royce. Loved loved the wine we had. Anyways onto the good stuff -- we had alll the things at dinner, so ranked in order of \\\\\"would eat again\\\\\" to \\\\\"skip it\\\\\": \\\\n\\\\n*Nick\\'s Pick - It was a BEAUTIFUL coppa served with sauerkraut, potatoes 2 ways, mustard \\\\u0026 miso for some umami. The meat was incredible \\\\u0026 the dish itself was basically perfection. \\\\n\\\\n*Roasted Marrow (tomato-onion jam, dry cured black olive crumble, rosemary, marrow pate a choux) - So flavorful and rich!! Yes, the tomato-onion jam may overwhelm the delicate marrow a bit but it\\'s perfect for winter. The pate a choux was awesome and the perfect vehicle for the tasty marrow and tomato-onion jam. Mm! \\\\n\\\\n*Charred Cauliflower (spicy romesco sauce, fluffy bottoms feta, pickled golden raisins, cilantro) - so nicely charred. The romesco was pretty dang spicy though \\\\u0026 I can handle eat. Overall, loved the flavors. \\\\n\\\\n*Bao Buns (steamed buns, house smoked yaki grilled meats, miso aioli, seasonal garnishes) - The seasonal grilled meat was a lovely holiday ham. The set up is a pretty standard bun though. \\\\n\\\\n*Glutinous Rice Dumplings (house meat filling, chewy dough locally sourced roe) - I don\\'t know what I was expecting but the actual experience was a bit like a half-assed Ham Sui Gok at dim sum (which is incredible). if that\\'s what this was trying to be, it missed the mark. \\\\n\\\\n*Charcuterie - it\\'s build your own here where each cheese/meat is costed out separately. I think I was mostly just disappointed by the bread. BUT don\\'t sleep on pickled shrimp. I\\'ve never had anything like it \\\\u0026 I love the corn butter that it\\'s served with. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the desserts were just OK. Although I was impressed by the idea of a Baklava donut, it was just OK. My dining companions loved the pot de creme, but eh pretty standard IMHO. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we came for brunch, I thought the experience was unique but not AS good as the stellar dinner we had. We had the congee, big bao (served more like a traditional chinese steamed bun). \\\\n\\\\nThe porterhouse we picked up from the butcher there was AMAZEEEE. I thought the sausages were OK.\"', ' \"This was a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I\\'m still thinking about the food a week later. Don\\'t miss out on this!\"', ' \"It was our first time here and will not be our last. The service and food were excellent. I like the casual atmosphere and reasonable pricing. You could come here for a nice night out or a casual evening out. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the chef\\'s special which was $55 per person. I honestly felt like that was a deal considering the quality of our five course meal. It started with a cheese, pickled blueberries and a salami spread. We enjoyed it! We added the marrow because, well... Marrow lol. I\\'m so glad we did. It was AMAZING. Scallops were a part of the meal and it was actually only the second time I\\'ve had them and by far the better. I now like scallops lol! Turkey meatballs that were insanely good, and a few other things. I\\'m writing this almost a week after I went, that\\'s the problem here. The dessert was a homemade vanilla and cinnamon icecream with some kind of cookie. Forgive the lack of pictures. I can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We eat all over Detroit and it\\'s a favorite here now.\"', ' \"This is my fourth experience at Marrow. Went there for brunch previously and tonite was my third time for dinner in the past year. \\\\nThe experience is very consistent. Great staff, eclectic and hipster atmosphere, a fresh menu from great ingredients, dishes that delight the discerning palate and amazing desserts. Short wine list but you will something to enjoy. Extensive liquor list for  whiskey and bourbon lovers. The parking could be better, but then again it is  Detroit Grit.\\\\nWe had seafood and vegan Yaki which were great. Our entrees were the scallops and Michigan steak and both were terrific. Flavorful and well presented. My wife went for  ice cream and I had the apple hand pie, oh my. \\\\nGreat experience and 10 minutes from home. This is our go to fix!\"', ' \"My wife and I just had dinner at Marrow a couple of days ago for my birthday, and it definitely hit the spot as it had been a while since I had steak.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance is pretty cool -- you walk into a butcher shop with a bar (meat + booze is a great combo!), and then you walk into their dining room off to the left. It\\'s dark but not too dark, and there\\'s background music that doesn\\'t overwhelm -- so it\\'s a great place for a date.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I split several cocktails and they were all very good -- I wish I remembered the names but you probably can\\'t go wrong with any of their specialty drinks.\\\\n\\\\nFor food, my wife and I split the charred cauliflower, which was tasty but probably a bit small \\\\u0026 overpriced -- though it was good, it led to us talking about other restaurants that do better cauliflower starters. Ironically, the roasted marrow was probably my least favorite thing here -- they put so much stuff on top that you can barely even taste the marrow itself. My entree, however, was delicious -- the local Michigan beef of the day was a tenderloin that was perfectly seasoned \\\\u0026 cooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe service, while friendly \\\\u0026 helpful, was slow. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order, and then another long wait to take our food order after we asked a few questions. The dishes were slow to come, too. I would\\'ve expected the marrow and cauliflower to come out at the same times, but they came out about 10 minutes apart from each other, and then we waited a long time for our entrees to come. The place was only about half-full, which is why the 2+ hours we spent there felt a bit excessive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d definitely come back because the steak was delicious, but there are some areas for improvement.\"', ' \"OMG IM IN LOVE  \\\\n\\\\n  Any restaurant that puts congee on the menu once football season kicks in steals my heart.  In Michigan, we\\'re slow to catch on to the beauty of congee, and ramen for that matter, and so I will live my best Brunch life at Marrow all season this year.\\\\n\\\\nCongee should feel rich, and weighty, and warm, and deep and once you finish it, you should feel full AND light at the same time.  Hence the magic. And it\\'s perfectly don\\'t here AND done with roasted squash, not meat, which was equally satisfying and surprising at a place called Marrow butchery and restaurant, lol.\\\\nMy husband had the bacon and egg ramen. Oh Lordy, just look at my pictures. Happy happy happy.\\\\nWe also shared the brunch dumplings, which were good but not on the same plane as these two main dishes.. I think we\\'ll share the baos next time instead.\\\\nOn the way out, we stopped in the butchery and brought home their house made meatloaf and house made English muffins for tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nCocktail menu was so so spot on too... I had The Suffragette with a Liberator gin base, (See menu pic), and it just sat perfectly with the meal.\\\\n\\\\nI just truly cannot wait to go back. (And with tip, I spent $80 for two on an app, two Brunch dishes and one cocktail.. and I don\\'t spend that lightly, so that\\'s how good it was). I spent another $22 on my way to the door.  And happy  to do it at a farm to table, environmentally conscious food purveyor in the west village neighborhood.  Love it!\\\\n\\\\nFabulous service too. Comfortable vIbe.\\\\n\\\\nUPDATE: as noted above, we bought a few things at the butchery on our way out the door that we loved so much, I went right back today just to stock my freezer.  I\\'m a vegetarian but my husband loved their \\\\\"Mara\\'s Meatloaf\\\\\", (it\\'s covered in bacon!), and their homemade English muffins are KILLER... like, I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had a fresh English muffin before? But the gentleman there today told me they use a sourdough starter which could also explain it.. they\\'re amazing. I bought three packages for the freezer.  So even if they\\'re packed and you don\\'t have a reservation, go right to that freezer near the bar and bu your dinner for home!  I also bought a spicy marinated tofu sandwich and a giant bao for us for tonight.\"', ' \"After seeing Marrow on a list of the top 14 restaurants in the US, I was eager to see what all of the hype was about. I made a reservation but showed up early in hopes of finding a spot on the patio which worked out perfectly and were seated immediately. Both the inside and the patio area are relatively small, the patio equipped to hold 4 groups of around 6. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Marrow is based on availability and changes very frequently, ensuring you will always have what\\'s fresh and in season as well as trying something that may be outside of your normal, but can also differ from that posted online. The day of our reservation I had decided on which dishes we would like to try only to find out that one of the dishes was no longer available and was replaced by another. Nevertheless, opted for Butter Braised Turnips, Roasted Marrow, and Rhubarb Basted Scallops and everything was delicious. As for drinks, I asked for a club soda with lime, which considering they had a full-service bar I assumed would come in a glass as usual but was served Topo Chico instead. Fine. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as any specific dietary needs, the kitchen is ready to accommodate by narrowing down the menu to that which suits your needs and in the worst case, slightly altering the dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe food came in a timely fashion and upon arrival was introduced by the server who further explained the dish. The presentation was pleasing and made me eager to dig in. All three of the dishes were delicious and the layering of flavors was spot on. The scallops were cooked just right and complimented well by the subtle pesto and smokey dukkah. All in all, the dishes were thoughtfully put together and it shows. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is also a butcher shop with a decent selection of fresh meat and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nThere is plenty of street parking around the building. Both bathrooms feature changing tables \\\\n\\\\nTIP: If you\\'re interested in sitting outside, be prepared to encounter flies. At one point after our food had arrived I was constantly swatting at a handful of thicc green bottle flies (the big ones). It was annoying.\"', ' \"I haven\\'t had a formal sit down meal here yet but what I HAVE had has been a 5 star experience. My aunt and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon to get some stuff from the market and we also got some grab and go sandwiches and ate at the bar. Everything was top notch!\\\\n\\\\nTo go I got a package of dry aged burgers (which we threw on the grill last night and OMG SO GOOD) a frozen meatloaf (probably my least favorite thing I purchased. It just didn\\'t click with me so I probably wouldn\\'t get it again), a container of smoked chicken salad (YUMMM), a container of smoked whitefish spread (double YUMMM), and a link of kielbasa. As a Polish gal whose family used to make our own kielbasa I can get kind snobby about it and while this link was different than the kind we would make (or the kind I now purchase from Hamtramck) it was incredible. A little smokier, a little more garlic. But just really really great. \\\\n\\\\nI got the ham sandwich to eat in and it was also delicious. \\\\n\\\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for a sit down experience. And you know I\\'ll be back for all those market purchases again, too!\"', ' \"Off the beaten path, in a residential area. Awesome and cute focused meat restaurant and \\\\\"butcher shop\\\\\" all in one. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the food:\\\\nHalf of the menu is shareable plates. There are meant and seafood meals.\\\\nYou can make your own charcuterie board\\\\nSmall section of appetizers called \\\\\"Snacks\\\\\"\\\\nA few speciality cocktails\\\\nLarge array of spirits (they hardly had popular/common liquors, alot of lesser known brands)\\\\n\\\\nService:\\\\nExcellent service by host and server! Our server was very informative of the menu! She litearlly broke down every item and was so friendly, even taking a pic of our group.\\\\n\\\\nPlace:\\\\nCute little modern spot, broken out by 2 different rooms. When you walk in, you see a large beautiful bar and a \\\\\"butcher counter\\\\\" where you can purchase meat for home. Lots of meat options. The other side was a small dining area and the kitchen was somewhat exposed. Limited seating. We sat at a large communal table.\\\\n\\\\nOther observations:\\\\n-Environmentally conscious (no plastic)\\\\nhad an organic/simple feel and ambiance\\\\n-presentation is very very important here. they take pride in making sure everything looks great. \\\\n-The menu is very adventurous and maybe an acquired taste. A variety of  unique combinations. I would recommend taking a peek at the menu first before going but I promise you, you wont be disappointed.\\\\n-One downfall (besides small area) was there is no parking lot. You are literally parking off of  Kercheval or around the corner in a residential street. I\\'m sure the folks living there are not too pleased. The street was lined up with cars.\"', ' \"Not bad, fun to try but I don\\'t think I\\'m itching to come back. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the butcher shop aspect; I expected a more adventurous menu. That being said, sample menus are online so maybe I didn\\'t have any basis for that hope.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had the rice dumplings, the bao and nori butter, marrow, and noodles with corned tongue. For me, everything fell just a bit short, on the bland side. The rice dumplings were probably the best thing - I loved the chewy wrapper and bubbly crispiness where it was fried.\\\\n\\\\nThe bao was good and fluffy but I didn\\'t get enough of the seaweed flavor and forgot what why we had ordered it while eating it. \\\\n\\\\nThe marrow was a huge portion, with tons of actual marrow, so that was exciting since you usually get so little. It had a blueberry and dill, which was a little too medicinal for something rich and greasy. It came with these puff balls that were eggy, which I would have preferred a regular bread or something more porous and lighter to go with the marrow.\\\\n\\\\nThe noodles were probably the most interesting dish, but I thought the sauce was bland. I did really like the tongue, but the noodles were mushy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the issues I have about the food are just a personal preference and I wouldn\\'t expect any restaurant to make everyone happy. I do wish there were more organs offered on the menu. If I saw some heart, sweetbreads, liver, tripe, etc, I would give it another try.\"', ' \"WOW WOW WOW. This place just skyrocketed to my favorite restaurant around Detroit. Marrow is such a gem tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village. It features an eclectic menu with asian flares ranging from delicious meat dishes to intricate salads highlighting the freshness of Local Michigan produce. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the butter bao bun, burratta salad, pork  belly special as well as the gnocchi special. Much of the menu is seasonal and consistently rotates which brings such an exciting element to the menu as they highlight in-season produce from local farms. Every dish was incredible in both flavor and presentation. We finished off our meal with the butter cake dessert and although it took some time to come out, they were so kind and even covered the dessert for us. They definitely did not have to do that but it\\'s a testament to the incredibly high quality of service that accompanies this meal. While it\\'s so hard to pick a favorite since we loved everything, I was most blown away by the gnocchi dish-- the gnocchi were literal clouds, enhanced by the finely chopped shrimp and chicken of the woods mushroom, and pulled together by this decadent corn butter. I could go on and on about everything we ate but I encourage to just try it for yourself-- you won\\'t be disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nI loved how they took classic dishes and put such intricate international spins on them and I especially loved the way they wove in asian ingredients. This female founded restaurant and butcher shop shows the innovative and delicious future of the Detroit food scene.

We had the bao, the yakitori (which happened to be an amazing lamb based deconstructed gyro on this night), the tongue (at Marrow, dinner tastes you!), shrimp and gnocchi, and a cauliflower dish whose details escape me.  For me, the bao and the yakitori were the stars of the evening.\\\\nService was just right - attentive without hovering, making for a very pleasant dining experience.\\\\nBe sure to wander past the butcher cases in the shop while you\\'re coming or going - they are sure to either inspire, or make you hungry.\"', ' \"3.5 stars.  I went here for my birthday and had a solid meal.  I had the tasting menu and I have to agree with others, that compared to other places that amount was a bargain.  However, I had issue with the pacing of the meal, as some dishes just took too long to come out. We actually order additional food just because we were getting too hungry between dishes.  My wife and I still ended up eat more at home.  The highlights for me were the rice dumplings and the cauliflower, nothing else really stood out for my tastes.\\\\n\\\\nService was spot on and while we were there the owner popped in and was busy scanning the room and greeting guest, which was nice.

I like pickled veggies but I felt like all the other ingredients were a bit overshadowed by them. The congee was very satisfying and comforting. However, again, I felt that there was too much pickled veggies on it. I removed most of them so I could actually taste the congee and not just pickled veggies.

I have been to other restaurants in the area so I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood, and I believe its a good addition. We finally made a trip to Detroit\\'s Eastside to try out their brunch menu (haven\\'t had dinner from here yet). The business itself is a combination of a restaurant and a butcher. Its not a terribly large dining area, but it wasn\\'t packed either so it felt comfortable enough. We liked the menu selection so as usual my wife and I ordered a little of everything and shared. Food was very good. I hate tofu, but the tofu scramble had terrific texture and took on the flavors of the spices quite well. The fried potatoes they serve were some of the best I\\'ve ever had, and the pumpkin pancakes were warm and fluffy (although I didn\\'t care for the whipped coconut cream, which had a very off-putting after taste). My only other complaint with the food was the lamb flatbread barely had any lamb, but besides that it was excellent. The place is not cheap, but you shouldn\\'t expect it to be for the quality of the food you\\'re getting. If portion sizes is an issue for you, might be best to try another restaurant cause you won\\'t be full off one item alone.\"', ' \"I\\'m fighting with a rating. I think the butcher\\'s shop/charcuterie offerings are among the best in the area and deserve a four or even a five. The restaurant? The restaurant (at least for dinner service) gets a three. Not necessarily because the food was terrible or the service was terrible. The stars say it: it was just okay for me. We ordered the chef\\'s selection which I always expect to be maybe more inspired and wild than the menu. The bites were average and not with a whole lot of flavor. One of the offerings was a kimchi ceasar - I was hoping for a super funky mash up but it just tasted like spicy raw cabbage. We also had a scallop, a meatball, a lamb kofta, etc. It just felt like course after course of meh. The final course consisted of a financier that could put out a car window - maybe the only hard miss of the evening. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, at the risk of sounding like That Yelp Reviewer, I have my Servsafe certification so I know a tiny little bit about food safety. I spied a few more flies than I was comfortable with in the bar/shop area which concerned me a little. \\\\n\\\\nThere are too many places I like in Detroit and places I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m probably not going back for a meal.

We were able to get seats at the bar/counter that faces the kitchen. This was overall fine, though the stools were uncomfortable. Marrow\\'s menu is small, focusing on, of course, meat and butchery. The prices are fairly high, expect to spend if you do not want to leave hungry. What I did not like about the menu was that it was unclear what was a small plate and what was more meal size. While the service overall was very good, I do think the server could have clarified better about this aspect of ordering.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the dumplings, which were delicious though very sticky. We were probably making odd faces for a bit trying to clear our teeth. We also ordered the pickled veggies, which were the opposite of the dumplings.

For the mains, we the scallops, ordered the Szechuan noodles and a curry dish. The scallops and the curry were both amazing. My friends liked the noodles, but I found the flavor odd. The noodles and curry were both meal sizes, the scallops were very light.

I walked out feeling satisfied and full. \\\\nMy only negative about this (and honestly it reflects on the waiter) is that we upgraded to beef instead of pork.

This turned out to be a great choice because we got to try a lot of different things and didn\\'t have to make any decisions.  Everything was so good, with larger portions than a traditional tasting menu, and well-paced. We did order an additional dish of the Roasted Marrow, because it wasn\\'t part of the Chef\\'s Selections, and come on, the place is called Marrow! We were glad we did, because it was delicious. It\\'s hard to pick favorites among the many varied dishes we got to taste, but the ones that stick out to me (besides the marrow) are actually the simplest- the charcuterie board because of its variety (not only meat and cheese, but also two different kinds of jam, pickles, marinated celery, nuts, and served with airy puff pastries), and the dessert because it looked so unassuming but surprised me with how delicious it was (it was just a madeleine, ice cream, and blueberry compote, but there was ginger in something, and maybe some other kind of spice, and the flavors just all melded together so well, it was magical). We will definitely be back to Marrow- there are still so many delicious things on the menu left to try, plus there\\'s brunch!\"', ' \"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I\\'d do it.  The atmosphere is unparalleled with the butcher shop in the main room of the restaurant. Once we were seated in the dining room, our waiter was prompt in greeting us and telling us about the farm to table style the restaurant runs by. Many local and urban Detroit farms are where their ingredients are sourced from, which is freakin sweet! Their philosophy is also to use the whole animal and whole plant, which promotes less waste-- another thing we can get on board with!  He also asked us about any allergies or food restrictions which is such a personalized touch, it made the entire thing feel like it was personalized for us.

The Butcher\\'s Rillette for $8 was nicely presented in a tiny bowl with the jam and nuts already on top. It was good, but a little bit mild. The Bao Buns were fantastic! 3 steamed buns with rotating meats, served with pickled peppers, pickles, and dicon. The Tartare was well prepared and tasty, however, needed some acid or something. Plus a little weird that it is served with shrimp chips.  They almost go together well.  The Curry Noodles were very good. You can tell the pasta was freshly made in-house.  The Baklava Donut was great, but with both honey and the super sweet cream, a bit too sweet. \\\\n\\\\nOwner was there and is very nice.

There wasn\\'t one complaint about any of our brunch dishes and our server, Sydney was wonderful! We ordered mushroom dumplings, chorizo dumplings, the lamb/egg dish, steak and egg dish, shrimp and grits, and breakfast burger. OMG. Welcome to flavortown. My personal favorites were the chorizo dumplings, steak (cooked perfectly medium to medium rare), and the turnip cake which were complimentary (think of seafood spam, lol and just trust me). Bon appetit! \\\\n\\\\n------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: Solid restaurant, would come back again. Standout dishes were the marrow toast, beef tartare, meatballs, venison yakitori, and the sesame cake dessert with ice cream and caramelized miso. \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I noticed when I stepped in--beautiful restaurant and immensely busy at 7pm! The two hosts were busy, I get it, I used to work in a high end restaurant too, so I\\'m very understanding, but I think one of them could\\'ve been more friendly/smiling/warm just observing how they were interacting with myself and other patrons. There\\'s a bar right when you walk in and if you can get through the sea of people and turn left, there\\'s the dining area. Loved looking at their yummy products that you can take home. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I sat down I immediately noticed the menu. Menu was so cute; I loved how they tied it closed with a twine. I appreciate the details! :) Our waiter was wonderful--very attentive, as well as the others for always keeping our glasses filled. Great selection of wines. We wanted to try a lot of dishes, so we ordered the chef\\'s tasting menu as well as the beef tartare and tongue dishes. \\\\n\\\\nFirst up was the marrow toast, toast with jam (raspberry I think?) and Camembert, and prosciutto. All were excellent.  \\\\nBeef tartare was just lovely. I always get the beef tartare at Lady of the House which is nothing short of impeccable and this one at Marrow is just as good! Wonderful quality of meat. I highly recommend it. All the flavors (mushrooms, black garlic pur\\\\u00e9e, Chinese chives, and yolk) down to the chips worked well together. \\\\nThen came the Glutinous Rice Dumplings. Reminds me of childhood! When it came, we all took a whiff of it and it smelled so good. I\\'m familiar with the texture of this dumpling so it didn\\'t bother me. I can see how it would bother other people if they\\'re used to eating other types of dumplings as the texture is much thicker and chewier. The flavor was good but after we all tried it, we agreed that it could be elevated even more with some type of sauce. A fellow dining companion and I instantly thought of nuoc mam cham and how we would order more if we could dip it in that sauce, lol. It doesn\\'t have to be that exact sauce, but something to round it out (something sweet and acidic) and make it even better! I\\'m not knocking down the dumpling at all--it\\'s good, just think if they experiment a little more it would really blow it outta the park. Plus I think some type of sauce would help the dumpling not stick to your teeth LOL :) \\\\nNext up, the Venison Yakitori! OMG. Our first question after we took a bite was \\\\\"this is venison?!\\\\\" -- So tender and not gamey! \\\\nAfter that came the MEATBALLS. OMG. No words. Just order it. I will keep coming back to Marrow for the meatballs! We did the tasting menu so it may not be on the regular menu...chef\\'s selection is worth it! You won\\'t regret it, and I think it\\'s at a great price point of $50.\\\\nAfter the meatballs, was the Cabbage Caesar which was really refreshing and not heavy at all. It was a little spicy but not overpowering. The cured yolk was my favorite touch to that dish. \\\\nThe fried squash with dates wasn\\'t my favorite only because I really don\\'t like those two things, but you know what? It was good. They did a great job. Would I want to eat it again? No. Lol but I\\'m glad I tried it. \\\\nThe pork dish -- two plates of it came out. One was MUCH more fatty than the other, so that was kind of a bummer. Honestly, my favorite part of that dish was the Brussels sprouts. Nothing to write home about with that dish. \\\\nThanks for hanging in there, I\\'m almost done, lol. We also ordered the Tongue which wasn\\'t part of the chef\\'s menu. GREAT flavors but one of my friends and I just couldn\\'t get it out of our heads that we were eating tongue, lol. Our two male dining companions loved it. As I said, the flavors are delicious. The only thing we were curious of is how it would taste/feel if the outside was seared more because it just tasted floppy/slimy in our mouths. \\\\nAnd last but not least the DESSERT!! We had a sesame cake with ice cream (squash I think?) with caramelized miso! OMG. Instantly one of my favorite desserts! Don\\'t miss out on this or any of their other delicious sounding desserts. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, more hits than misses.

We started with the breakfast dumplings (spicy pork), which were okay. The spicy pork filling was good, but the dumpling texture was just okay, and I didn\\'t love the toppings that came with the dish. My brother ordered a side of pork belly, which he liked. He also got the big bao, which is like a Scotch egg in a steamed bun. This is a fun concept, but not so fun to eat? While all of the individual pieces tasted good, the dish was hard to eat. The pieces kind of separated when cut, and it was hard to get everything in one bite. But the dish that really complicated this review for me? The soft scramble with lamb yakitori. This small dish packed a delicious punch: good scramble, GREAT lamb yakitori (not dry or overcooked and wonderfully seasoned), great challah toast (they also offered English muffin or sourdough), and great tzatziki. I\\'d eat this dish again. Happily. The service was good. And none of the food was bad - but none of it stood out or wowed me except for that soft scramble and lamb yakitori dish.

Marrow stands firmly between these dueling forces, at once embracing the opportunity to offer residents of Detroit\\'s West Village a place to buy impeccably sourced meat and also recognizing that not every customer wants to cook it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath red-and-white vintage posters hawking bologna and steak, Marrow\\'s dinner tables beckon guests to commune over plates of seared corned-beef tongue, bowls of crunchy pork skin \\\\\"popcorn,\\\\\" and glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with juicy ground beef and topped with slivered radishes and either whitefish or salmon roe. Each meal nimbly challenges notions of what butcher-style fare can be by largely ignoring steak in favor of tart jars of pickled shrimp and yakitori skewers.\\\\n\\\\nOwner Ping Ho and chef Sarah Welch are committed to establishing a more sustainable work environment for kitchen staff that includes competitive salaries with access to health insurance, paid vacation, and maternity leave. Consider it of a piece with their mission of transparency: At Marrow, you can learn the provenance of the pork on your plate while also appreciating that the person who cooked it for you makes a living wage.

We did a salad before hand and some pork kabobs. Amazing! The meat is so delicious and delicate. \\\\n\\\\nThe tasting menu was very much worth it for those who did it. It was enough food and there was even a wine pairing you could choose to have as well. \\\\n\\\\nThe duck was the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked.

Right by Indian Village in Detroit, this felt a bit off the beaten path and then I realized Craft Work is just a few blocks away and this is a block over from Sister Pie. Almost a hidden gem. \\\\nAs I age, I\\'m becoming hesitant at times to try new places since I\\'m nowhere near hipster. I appreciated that the clientele varied and we were by no means the oldest. \\\\nIf you are a picky eater, or have limitations with your diet, they\\'re wonderfully accommodating. I have a gluten sensitivity but try to not be high maintenance about it. They came up with a solution for everything. \\\\nOur waitress (Quinn) was absolutely fantastic. Thorough in describing the menu and gave us great recommendations. \\\\nWe did start with charcuterie, which is always a personal fave for me. We also had the burrata, which was a little bit of a stretch for us because neither of us care for tomatoes. It was delicious and we even went outside our comfort zones and ate some of the tomatoes. :)\\\\nThe beef choice that evening was an aged New York strip, which my husband chose, while I had one of the pork selections for the evening. I will never be able to accurately remember what came with each but it was unique, flavorful and fun. \\\\nAs if we needed it, we did do two desserts. I can only remember the name of one (ice cream sundae with fun flavors; not your standard) but the second was just scrumptious. It had whipped cream, chocolate ganache and cherries. Enough said. \\\\nOf course we had beer and wine - and their list for either is varied. Love how many local names appear throughout the menu. \\\\nGreat experience overall.\"', ' \"The customer service here is phenomenal! The rillette was beautifully done, and the marrow was so delicate and delicious.\"', ' \"Wonderful butcher shop in West Village that serves dinner every night except Tuesdays.\"', ' \"Marrow is a welcome addition to the current business revitalization of West Village.

The specialty cocktails are carefully curated and delicious. Start your experience here.\\\\n\\\\nThe cozy dining space is waiting for you just around the corner. This is definitely a place to eat with friends, as you\\'ll want to try a little of everything. My group and I went into dining delirium as we feasted on plate after plate of delectable food.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, it\\'s a butcher shop - so, meat lovers, prepare to indulge. The lamb chops were honestly out of this world - succulent, seasoned, oversized. The memory is making my mouth water. There\\'s a lot of vegetarian options, too. The green salad included ripped ricotta and a croquette - delicious. We also had broccoli and smokey oysters, cured scallops, and a custom charcuterie. Each dish was made with care, melded together wonderfully unique flavors.\\\\n\\\\nEverything is farm to fork - supporting local, Michigan farms - and so very fresh. The service is top-notch.

If you want a vegetarian to know what meat tastes like without breaking their diet- have them order this.\\\\n-Pork belly dish with cherries, cherry compote and fermented mustard seeds.  Probably the best pork belly dish my wife and I ever had.\\\\n-Lamb loin prepared with a yogurt and fermented carrots.  I hate carrots, but when they taste like kimchi- I\\'m all about it.  Lamb was cooked to perfection and practically melted in our mouths.\\\\n-Butterscotch pudding dessert (I forget the french name of the dish).  It was the perfect light dessert after a heavy meal- good to share for 2 people.  We ordered the rhubarb and apple fritters too, which were good, but kind of heavy after a big meal.\\\\n\\\\nThings to note:\\\\n-It\\'s a small restaurant and it is loud, so plan accordingly. \\\\n-Like most trendy restaurants these days, the dishes are meant to be shared.\\\\n-Though it is meat themed, there were plenty of vegetarian options on the menu.\\\\n\\\\nSo don\\'t come with selfish eaters who are quiet talkers.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife and I ate at Animal in LA a couple of months ago, and our meal and service at Marrow was exponentially better.

Making sure the temperature was medium and it rested 20 minutes.  Looked good.  Couldn\\'t even chew it.  Never in my life have a ever tasted such a bland, tuff piece of meat!

First of all it\\'s not a super large establishment it\\'s actually what I would classify as the right size for premium service. Upon arriving at Morrow they were quite busy but not too busy for one of the three greeters at the door to greet me with a smile and ask how many would be with our party. They did say there\\'s two open seats at the bar but hold on let me see if we can get you at the chef\\'s table. Sure Nuff next thing you know I\\'m seated at the chef\\'s table looking at a menu that is totally amazing. Where do you start well Robert was there to help make some of the decisions we started with the Glutinous Rice Dumplings with meat filling and local roe upon arrival they looked amazing but the taste was truly incredible after taking the first bite your head and you\\'re body kind of enters a different universe and then after you chew and absorb the flavors and the texture you return back to Earth and say wow I\\'ve got to do that again and guess what with 3 dumplings you get multiple shots at it. Upon finishing the dumplings we ordered the daily steak selection which just happened to be ribeye we also ordered the Cured Scallops with parsnip puree grilled bok choy toasted peanuts and pomegranate.  I really don\\'t want to write a book about our experience at Marrows but let\\'s start with the ribeye the presentation phenomenal, as always in a higher-end restaurant I had the chef cook it to his preference let me tell you it was perfect the condiments that came with the steak were even more outrageous then I could have imagined what an experience dining on such a fine piece of meat graced with wonderful vegetables prepared excellently. The cured scallops where nothing short of marvelous every aspect on the plate was utilized for a flavor profile that cannot be explained on a review on Yelp it would require someone with a much better understanding of the English language to explain how truly marvellous the entire dining experience at Morrow was. Thank you for placing yourself in the city of Detroit for everyone to have an opportunity to dine like royalty, rock stars, and the ultra-elite. If I could give you one piece of advice it would be don\\'t change a thing because you can\\'t perfect perfection.\"', ' \"Great restaurant with a diverse menu full of really tasty selections. Easy parking on the street. Cool decor with several types of seating: communal picnic tables, a bar overlooking the kitchen, and regular tables. They also have a nice outdoor patio. We sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the chefs work. Had a great waitress who was really friendly and took great care of us. The food varies from small appetizers to small entrees, all of them shareable. To avoid too long of review, as we ordered a lot of stuff, I will just say that everything was great!! Tasty and well prepared. The only criticism I would have is that it is kinda pricey for the small servings you get. That\\'s why we ordered a lot of things, that being said, you get what you pay for. I feel it was well worth the price as the food was so good. They also have a meat counter where we took home some of the best bacon I\\'ve ever had (cooked for breakfast the next day). We will definitely be back for the food and that bacon!!!\"', ' \"Marrow knocks it out of the park from ambiance to every food item we tried on the menu. I was impressed by their large drink menu, and the reasonable bottle prices. We started off with a delicious bottle of champagne, but one thing to note is that they don\\'t pour your champagne when you need refills, which is surprising for a $100+ pp restaurant. We started with squash blossoms and a meat and cheese mini board, both extremely fresh and delicious. For our main, we chose the market steak (NY Strip $50) and Nick\\'s pick which was an italian sausage with a corn butter medley. If you have the opportunity to order sausage, which we had for both the board and a main, GET IT! It was seriously amazing both hot and cold. Finally, we wrapped it up with the Strawberry Shortcake. Order that one too, the strawberry ice cream and two biscuits were just incredible. Yes, this place is expensive, but yes it is worth it.\"', ' \"I have dined here twice since it opened, and I have to say, both were amazing experiences. It is a very small restaurant with a butcher shop and cocktail bar near the entry. They also have seating next to their kitchen, so you can watch your food being prepared from when it\\'s ordered to when it is expoed out to you. \\\\nThey have a rotating menu, so you never have to try the same thing twice! One of my favorites that seems to be a keeper on their menu is the pickled shrimp; there is a great balance of the bright pickle with a sweet corn butter and fresh toast. Absolutely phenomenal. \\\\n\\\\nNow, on my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I had truly one of the best experiences of service I\\'ve ever had. I, sadly, don\\'t recall his name, but our waiter had very detailed and accurate descriptors for each dish, wonderfully calm mannerisms, and perfectly balanced being present at the table and giving us space to enjoy the experience. A few of the highlights of our most recent visit was the firecracker shrimp, dry aged house beef with sunchokes and horseradish creme fresh, and the Brussel sprouts.

I talked to the hostess Kate and assured me that our reservation was all set for later that day.  Then she said, your anniversary huh, I\\'m going to set you at my Favorite Table, which turned out to be perfect.  Our waitress that night was really great, she explained the menu, We ordered some stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer along with a couple of craft beers.  For dinner we went with two of their specials for the day, some super tasty Lamb Chops and a Beef Tenderloin that not only was extremely tender but honestly rates up as one of my two top favorite steaks I have ever eaten and the other one was The Chicago Chop House in Chicago 25 years ago.  This is a small, quaint place with some outstanding food.  Bonus that they are also a butcher shop with prime beef, pork, specialty sausages, lunch meats and more that you can purchase to take home or as we learned, pick an item and have the waitress ask the chef as to how they will prepare it for you right there.  This is a Great Place for any special day.\"', ' \"Went on a wintry week night, so the place was very low key.  Which was nice, because I had to unexpectedly bump the rezzies at the last minute.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the vibe:  very gentrified.  Our server was training someone who usually worked the brunch shift.  When I ordered an old-fashioned, they even checked with the bartender to make a recommendation.  Both knew the menu pretty well, but faltered when asked exactly WHERE the local beef came from...it\\'s Detroit, after all, and you don\\'t exactly see cows out to pasture...\\\\n\\\\nThey asked about food allergies and worked closely with the chef to figure out dishes that might have coconut.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several dishes.

The food was tasty. We had the tartare which is raw meat and it was fresh and delicious. The bathrooms are clean as well.\"', ' \"This is definitely another one of those splurge dinners, but boy is it worth it. Fiance and I got the Tasting menu ($80 per person) and it was actually a very filling tasting menu. (Also note, we went on NYE, and they gave complimentary champagne :))\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, I was very happy with the way the chef incorporated Asian elements into the menu. It was very nostalgic. \\\\n- The Hamachi crudo was light and fresh and a clean way to start off the meal.\\\\n- The mushroom dumplings - DELISH. So good. I actually didn\\'t miss the fact that there wasn\\'t any meat in the dumpling. The dumpling was wrapped in an Asian wonton or dumpling wrapper (it had the great chew of an Asian dumpling) though it was wrapped kind of like a tortellini. The broth was also really light and clean, yet flavorful. Fiance literally picked up the bowl and drank the rest of the broth, he loved it that much.\\\\n- O.M.G. The OCTOPUS - literally my favorite. I am an octopus lover and my family knows to get me octopus dishes, and let me say this was the MOST tender octopus I\\'ve had yet. Literally we could have eaten like 20 skewers of these things. IT WAS SO GOOD.\\\\n- The radish salad was good - a good clean/light palate cleanser. I enjoyed the nuts. It was actually a rather large bowl of salad, which was surprising. I\\'ll admit my jaw got a little tired of chewing this though.\\\\n- The longevity noodles - another Asian nod - Though I was expecting the super thin mian xian that were endless (hence, longevity), these had some thick noodles. I can\\'t complain, I love noodles and these had that good chew that I love. Was a little too heavy on the oyster sauce though (slightly oversalty). \\\\n- The dry aged Ribeye - this was a surprise! They gave us a 16 oz ribeye, which was fairly large considering the portion sizes of everything else. The steak was actually delicious - it was well cooked, very tender, nicely pink. They actually didn\\'t season the steak, which I guess they didn\\'t need to - if you ate it with the kimchi or horseradish sauce, that lent the salt. The egg was yummy, and the kimchi pancake was really well fried and was very crispy. Our only gripe is PLEASE REPLACE THE STEAK KNIVES. It was absolutely impossible to cut the steak. The steak itself was really tender, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut through the fat/tendons. You need a serrated knife or a sharper knife. It was legit a work out trying to cut the steak, and that took away from the enjoyment of eating it.\\\\n- Dessert: Goat cheese and black currant jam with a cracker like thing and a ginger ice cream with sesame cake. Both were delish. The goat cheese was a savory counterpoint to the sesame ice cream and was a little reminiscent of blue cheese (one of my few food HATES). But it was still good with the black current jam. The Cheese lent a creamy texture to the tart jam. \\\\nAnd the ginger ice cream - was very gingery, which I don\\'t mind, but if you\\'re a ginger hater beware. It worked really well with the sesame cake (a little dry and crumbly, and not at all sweet). But a bit of ice cream + cake + miso caramel (that mainly just tasted like salted caramel) all together was a really nice bite.\\\\n\\\\nWe also got a Bone Marrow starter. It was decent. I\\'m honestly not sure if I just don\\'t really know what bone marrow should be like, but to me it almost felt like it could have used an extra 30 sec or so of grilling? Also could have used more bread than the 3 cream puff pastries. But the onion jam was yummy and helped cut the fat\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is a great place to come if you are willing to spend extra money celebrating for a special occasion. It is definitely pricey and not somewhere I\\'d come often at all. But food was DELISH. Ambiance was kind of romantic with soft lighting.\"', ' \"Phenomenal! We went here for my husbands birthday and this place did not disappoint. We started with the rice dumplings. I cannot explain how wonderful these dumplings were! For dinner we had their two specials: one was cassoulet with a French style sausage (the real winner was the pieces of French baguette they had with it) and a picanha (top sirloin steak) with kimchi and sunflower roots. I honestly don\\'t think you could go wrong with anything on this menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food, staff, and overall atmosphere were just perfect. Can\\'t wait to come back and try the family style chef\\'s menu!\"', ' \"I really enjoyed my dinner here and so did my 4 companions. We all chose the tasting menu at $50 a person. For all the food we got and the quality, it seemed like a reasonable price. The ambiance here is really nice, comfortable table size, not too loud, and of course the butcher shop next door. Our server was attentive plus we had multiple others bringing our food to us at nice intervals. \\\\n\\\\nBecause it\\'s the tasting menu, most things came in 2 plates or bowls that we shared between us. There was always at least 5 of whatever we were getting since there were 5 of us. Highlights were the marrow toast, the scallop, the sausage on the stick - so tasty!, the meatballs were delicious, and the lamb gyro. We were started off with a charcuterie board, it had the best, most melt in your mouth ham I have ever had. I need to get some of that. Interesting combos of jams, nice pickled veggies, kimchi, so many good things. My only complaint is the first 3 courses had bread involved. The bread pieces with our first 2 courses were very hard, to the point I joked to my friend I was worried I was going to cut the roof of my mouth. The marrow on toast was much softer as it had absorbed the juices - so it was delicious. Just too much bread to start the meal I thought - not enough variety.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was delicious, plus since it was a friends birthday he got an additional dessert of chestnut ice cream that was incredible. Kudos for the ice cream and candle!\\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered cocktails and I have to say that was another oddity - I told our server I would like the Valentine White Blossom vodka with cranberry. He said - we don\\'t have cranberry. I asked what do you have as a mixer then? He suggested Sprite. What!?, vodka \\\\u0026 Sprite? I said no thanks. He left to find out other options, came back and said they did have cranberry juice, I said ok, plus a lime. Well when it came - it was unsweetened, plain cranberry juice. Very tart, not pleasant to drink and not what I was expecting. I guess I thought the bartenders would do a better job with drink ideas if they\\'re offering a page of spirits - they must have some idea how to mix them to make a cocktail (I thought). I switched to a glass of Pinot Noir which was much more pleasant with my dinner. My friend got a glass of Pinot Grigio - which she thought was too sweet for a Pinot. 3 other cocktails off the pre-made menu were had, and enjoyed by the other diners. The Suffragette, Pepper \\\\u0026 Smoke, and 1 other that escapes me. We all tried them and thought they were good.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a positive experience, I would come back again and try individual things off the menu. Plus I think I want to come back and buy some meat from the butcher side - looked at a few things as I was leaving and thought the quality and price looked great.\"', ' \"Excellent food, Excellent service, and great atmosphere.

They have a great location in a neighborhood with few sit down options. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking, particularly for a \\\\\"nice\\\\\" restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nI called beforehand to make a reservation. When we walked in it took the hostess 5 minutes to even acknowledge our presence. She wasn\\'t even facing the customers, and was deeply engrossed in a phone call. We were standing two feet from her. We should have walked out then. The hostess then leisurely led us to bar seating that faced the kitchen. I was taking my mom out for her birthday dinner and she had just arrived in Detroit after a long drive from Chicago. I kindly asked if it was possible to have a conventional low table, after all the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess said the low tables (80% of the seating) was reserved for reservations. I reminded her that I made a reservation. The hostess then deliberately walked back to the front to speak with her manager, while we we were left to wait in the middle of the dining area. 10 minutes later hostess and manager returned and told us that we could only eat at the bar, and that the low seating was reserved for people with reservations that specifically asked for low seating. I\\'ve never heard of a customer needing to make this distinction. Feeling annoyed, unwelcome and like we had just wasted 15 minutes of our time, we left the restaurant. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Craft Work is a great restaurant nearby so we drove there instead. The Craft Work staff provided us with a real table immediately and we enjoyed a very nice meal with great service. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have never given a bad review on yelp or any site before, as I think most small businesses need all the help they can get. But these people seem to be forgetting basic tenets of restaurant service like making guests feel welcome and attended to. This place and some of their staff definitely came off to me like they were \\\\\"trying too hard\\\\\" and soberly striving to reach some \\\\\"it factor\\\\\" of culinary coolness. I\\'m getting too old for that nonsense.\"', ' \"Oh my.  Determined to dine in West Village, the four of us descended upon Marrow last night.  We all had the chef\\'s menu...7-8 courses with each one fantastic.  The chef adjusted on the fly and added a tenderloin for my daughter (grilled perfectly).  My guess is that everything on the menu is fantastic, but do yourself a favor and have their scallops.  They\\'re grilled on a sort of wood box grill that adds the perfect touch of smokiness to the dish.  From Anchorage to Seattle to New York to LA, Marrow has the best scallops I\\'ve ever had.  Lastly, our server was fantastic, fun and engaging.  Can\\'t wait to go back.\"', ' \"Super impressed with this place. Went there and got the tasting menu. At first I was nervous because the portions were on the smaller side but there was so much food that came out I left stuffed. I highly recommend trying this place and doing the tasting menu. It was relatively inexpensive for a steakhouse and worth every penny.\"', ' \"Marrow was an absolutely wonderful experience. From decor, to flow of the restaurant, service, and the main star of the evening the food. We started with the charcuterie which was full of flavor, followed by the marrow toast which was a delight. Next had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, followed by the \\\\\"From the Butchers Case\\\\\" which was lamb kafta. The lamb was wonderfully cooked and tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend this restaurant.\"', ' \"Wow.  Yum.  Each dish was exceptional and unique.  The restaurant is lovely with a great staff.  Everyone was wonderful but our server Stephanie was amazing and made the night extra special. Will be back and also try the butcher shop.\"', ' \"Disappointing.

Steak truly cooked the right way!\"', ' \"Excellent food, friendly service and even better atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nReservation is recommend specially over the weekend\"', ' \"This is a butcher shop and restaurant. They had one red meat offering at 55 dollars. I do not understand how a shop filled with red meat could only offer one red meat meal.  I kept asking you have a wall full of meat and you only offer one steak at dollars , I do not understand !\"', ' \"I visited Marrow for the first time last night, at the recommendation of a friend.  We started with the Bao and Butter.  The boa buns had a flavorful seasoning and were fluffy and light, almost reminiscent of a soft pretzel crossed with a traditional bao.  They came with a hearty helping of seaweed infused butter.  A delicious warm up to the meal.\\\\nNext up was the Charcuterie.  We had the Pork Rillette and a cheese whose name escapes me which came with a blueberry spread as well as crackers.  The rillete was delicious paired with the blueberry spread, as well as the cheese we selected.\\\\nNext was the Steak Tartare.  This was a different take on tartare than I\\'ve experienced previously.  It was left more chunky than pureed (a big plus to me!) and was infused with citrus and cilantro flavors, and served with a seaweed fortune cookie as it\\'s delivery mechanism.  It is truly the best tartare I have had, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!\\\\nNow, the Roasted Bone Marrow. This was the crown jewel of the night.  A monster piece of bone, filled with delicious marrow, topped with herbs and pickled blueberries.  It was served with pate a choux puffs, which you filled to make a savory puff.  This melt in your mouth explosion of flavor is something you must experience for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and order this dish.\\\\nFinally, we had the Spicy Szechuan Udon Noodles with corned pork tongue.  The tongue was flavorful, tender, and there was ample amounts of it in the dish.  The udon was well cooked and the sauce was just enough spice to build up nicely without being overwhelming.  This dish also included fiddlehead ferns, which I had never had but reminded me of a nicely charred asparagus!\\\\n\\\\nI have nothing but compliments on my meal here! In addition, this 5 dish meal was $100 total, split between two people, which for the quality, thought, and preparation of the meal and knowledgeable server suggestions, is hard to beat.\"', ' \"I\\'ve been looking forward to trying this place since the James Beard semifinalist lists came out and I really wanted to love it. The 3 stars is for the food unfortunately. It\\'s a great concept and and I love that it\\'s located in a transition area and will hopefully bring energy and a bit of cool new Detroit vibe to the area. We liked the ambience and the service was good. Appetizers and smaller plates were good, the bao buns were worth coming back for. But larger plates looked and sounded great but some ultimately just didn\\'t taste great or lacked balance. Corned tongue was pretty good. Shrimp stir fry was pretty good if a bit too salty (a side of plain rice would have made it perfect). Michigan beef special (Brazilian style?) had a lot going on but was just ok. And Bao burger special in particular was almost inedible. It\\'s as if someone came up with the concept but no one actually tasted the dish before selling it to the customers. Beef tasted uncooked even though it was cooked to medium per our request, the bun was salty and had a mouth feel like under-baked dough. Kimchi didn\\'t do anything for the dish except to accentuate the weird taste of the beef. A straight up well grilled burger on a toasted bun would have been a way better way to feature good beef. With the luxury of a good butcher shop on premise, I wish they\\'d focus more on the goodness that is a good piece of seared, caramelized, well salted meat and less on making it so complicated and trendy. I know the menu changes all the time so maybe we went on an off night/week? Will have to give it another try but I\\'m not sure I\\'d run back here given so many other options in Detroit.\"', ' \"Excellent and creative menu. Wine and liquors are from local wineries and distilleries. Options for vegetarians as well.\"', ' \"Amazing addition to the neighborhood! Been a couple times now and have been blown away by the quality of the food and the wine selection! \\\\n\\\\nStarted with a huge charcuterie (the pickled shrimp is so tasty), then moved on to the radicchio salad, tempura delicata squash (phenomenal!), and Mapo Mushrooms. \\\\n\\\\nAll the food is amazing, but the noodles and broth is life changing! The broth is complex and full of flavor topped with a silk smooth duck egg....I\\'ve never had a \\\\\"ramen\\\\\" so tasty!\\\\n\\\\nHad several great desserts and more than a few bottles of wine. \\\\n\\\\nStaff and management are all well seasoned professionals and really know how to treat their guests. :)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck it out, I doubt you\\'ll be disappointed.\"', ' \"Came in last week and sat at the counter for a really indulgent and enjoyable night. Our server was incredibly attentive and thorough, taking the utmost care that my friend\\'s shellfish allergy was accommodated and ensuring that we were totally content all evening, which we certainly were! My companion and I shared a charcuterie board, the roasted cauliflower, the marrow (when in Rome, right?), and a dessert of small donuts that reminded me of a beignet mixed with a churro and a sesame whipped cream. Everything was delectable and intricately finessed, and we had a great experience from top to bottom. So glad to have finally visited!\"', ' \"The food, environment, and ambience are excellent. I love their changing menu salad every time and desserts were also noteworthy. I\\'d like to compliment the staff and owner for their genuine hospitality. It\\'s been a long time since me or my guests have been wowed by a server\\'s excellent attentiveness to detail.

Thanks to the owner, Lauren, and the rest of the staff for making our experiences at Marrow so memorable. Keep up the good work!\"', ' \"I absolutely loved the meal I had here. I can\\'t wait to return. The tartare was fantastic. Every dish was delicious, including the baklava donut dessert.

It helped us decide what to do!\"', ' \"Great experience. Really enjoyed everything that I ate. I sat at the bar and chatted up some of the folks. Marrow has a great atmosphere.

The fried pork popcorn app is super yum and goes great with cocktails. I didn\\'t love the yakitori it was really fatty but I don\\'t know much about Asian cuisine so it could have been an item not suited for me. I had the scallops and I very much enjoyed all of the flavors. The con on this item for me was that it was room temperature almost cold? I didn\\'t care for where my dinner mate and I were seated we were by the end window in a small table that every waiter kept walking through and it made dinner service a little annoying at times. I also didn\\'t care for how the cheese and meat are ala carte but maybe I overlooked an option where you could pick a combo of three or more, or a make your own board or chefs choice. The desserts were fabulous get the pot of chocolate and ice creams! Overall it was pretty fantastic and all of the flavors were really on point. Hats off to the creator of the menu items and flavor combos. Nice work!\"', ' \"Chefs Selection is a must try so detailed and creative.

Will be back.\"', ' \"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious! The location is somewhat surprising based on the surrounding area but the restaurant had a parking lot right next to their building. I had a Bloody Mary that was phenomenal. We split and order of the breakfast dumplings which were unique and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Big bao and I ordered the lamb yakitori scramble and we were both very happy. We ate in the dining room side but I would love to also sit at their beautiful bar. We will definitely be back soon!\"', ' \"This 5 stars is specifically for the brunch. I tried the dumplings (both chorizo and mushroom), the big bao, and the breakfast burger. Everything was phenomenal. This is my second favorite burger in Detroit.

Looking forward to coming back!\"', ' \"This place lived up to all that I expected.  The Mull It Over Signature Cocktail was fantastic.  The glutinous rice dumplings were delicious and the fish roe was a delicious addition.  The corned tongue was a wonderful mix of flavors.  The dessert I had was really good.  It was a sundae with three different ice creams with a rich chocolate sauce to pour over all of it. My server at the bar was excellent.  Definitely will be returning in the future.  Thanks to the PBS show Dine and Dish Nation for reviewing this restaurant\"', ' \"This will probably turn into a 5-star review when I\\'m there next. Service can be a bit spotty (long waits, forgotten orders) but waitstaff are friendly.  Marrow, yakitori, congee and bao are great. Tartare is good but please, no potato chips - toast points would be better. The owner keeps a sharp eye on the place (we saw her circulating) which is probably why the food was good. Only misstep was the brussel sprouts which were drowning in an overly sweet gochujang-based sauce - my suggestion would be to do a take on Korean fried cauliflower or stuffed peppers with ground pork. \\\\n\\\\nThe other issue is noise. Too many hard surfaces=deafening levels of noise during peak hours. My NIOSH sound level meter registered an exceedingly high decibel reading which is probably why I would never come here again on the weekends. I know acoustic control is expensive but even some spray-on foams would make a huge difference. \\\\n\\\\nLast but not least, for extra shiok points and to make all of us with fond memories of living in S\\'pore or Malaysia happy: please introduce your  take on laksa, rendang, nasi lemak or bak chor mee onto the menu. I will literally eat at Marrow everyday if you do. Thank you.\"', ' \"A great find!  I\\'ve been here with a small group and the larger dinner group (12).  The Chef Tasting knocks it out of the park.  Meatballs have a nice kick and crunchy topping, lamb kofta with tzadziki AND chimichurri!  Salads to die for (my meat eaters were licking the plate).  Great service, very knowledgeable and personable staff.  You\\'ll have a great dinner, and take home a steak or chop from the butcher shop!\"', ' \"This was one of the best meals I have ever had (and I\\'m a very picky about where I eat and don\\'t give out great reviews willy-nily)!

After reading the Facebook reviews and hearing from friends to try this place I had to. But it was not what I had expected.\"', ' \"I love red meat, and this place is amazing. We had a reservation, and upon arrival were seated promptly. The service throughout the entire meal was superb, and the place was packed considering it was the Saturday before New Year\\'s eve. We ordered the Chef\\'s menu plus a few add-ons, and we completely stuffed by the time the meal was over. Our waitress Lauren was phenomenal.  Not only was she attentive, funny, and quick, she was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu and the wine/spirit list. She made sure we understood exactly what we were getting into regarding the Chef\\'s menu.  This restaurant was also asked about food allergies, and was accommodating when I couldn\\'t have some of the times on the Chef\\'s tasting menu. They Lauren easily substituted items that she felt would go well with that day\\'s menu. \\\\n\\\\nI was extremely nervous about getting the beef marrow and the beef heart dishes, but they were cooked so well and tasted so good, I am an absolute convert!! I cannot wait to go back and explore more of the menu. I would like to say that they noticed that they forgot to give us one of the entrees (there are four in the chef\\'s menu), we hadn\\'t noticed but they brought it to our attention, and made it right. They gave us a gift certificate for when we return, plus an extra dessert to go.   Finally a restaurant in Detroit that not only has amazing food but superb service that is expected when a dinner for two costs over $200. I cannot wait to return!\"', ' \"My friends and I live in the West Village and have tried and tried and TRIED with Marrow. We have come for dinner, neighborhood drinks, buying meat and bones and we have had enough with the crazy bad service. Tonight as usual, the hostess didn\\'t acknowledge us when we walked in, she was reading a book and on her phone and looked truly inconvenienced to help us. So we just walked around the restaurant aimlessly until we had to walk back and inconvenience her to help us. This has happened several times, where the hostess has failed to even say hello, let alone try to service us. I\\'m not sure why someone is being employed to read a book and disregard patrons. The host is the face of the restaurant and we can\\'t continue to spend the amount of money that Marrow charges to feel invisible.

Would return for the steaks.\"', ' \"Had lunch Saturday, group of 5 so able to sample many dishes. Firstly the space is bright comfortable and fresh. Waitstaff is extremely educated and knowledgeable about what they serve, so no unexpected surprises. We had almost the entire brunch menu. This restaurant is not just for serious carnivores. Great vegetarian/gluten and anything else free friendly menu. All dishes were prepared and presented well. Really a great assortment of tastes, textures and flavors.  Ok we all loved it. Thanks!\"', ' \"Disappointing.   It pains me to write a poor review of Marrow because we had such high expectations for this beautiful restaurant, but neither the food nor the service was very memorable. \\\\nWe arrived without a reservation and were told there was a 90-minute wait but we could eat at the chef\\'s counter, which we did.  Throughout the evening several of the empty tables remained empty so it appears they are being a little too generous with their time allowance if diners don\\'t show up. \\\\nAs others have mentioned, the restaurant is beautiful.  They\\'ve done a wonderful job with the interior and thankfully made it unique instead of copying the trends that so many other restaurants have followed recently.  (ie. No Edison bulbs)\\\\nWe started with a couple of draft beers-both nice.  We then notified our server we would be sharing all plates and started with the marrow toast and the dumplings.  Neither were good.  The toast was hard yet very greasy and had little marrow on it.   The dumplings were presented beautifully but had little flavor and were either under cooked or intentionally \\\\\"doughy\\\\\" such that they stuck to the roof of your mouth.  Not good at all.  \\\\nWe then ordered the kimchi Caesar salad and the scallops.  The salad was the star of the show.  Delicious with a perfect dressing that had a hint of Szechuan peppercorns.  The portion was also quite large.  \\\\nThe scallops were disappointing.  They (3 for $26) were large and perfectly cooked but also had minimal flavor.  The brown butter vinaigrette and peanuts didn\\'t do the scallops justice.  \\\\nOverall the food was very bland.  Maybe with some tweaking they can get everything right or maybe we just ordered the wrong items in a meat centric restaurant.  \\\\nThroughout the evening our dirty dishes were not removed until long after the course was complete. Our plates were never replaced.  We had to eat all four courses off the same dirty plates that had sauces from the previous course.  I realize this is a new restaurant but this level of service is not acceptable.  The restaurant is made up of industry veterans and they should know better. In addition, they also include a \\\\\"Suggested Tip\\\\\" section at the bottom of the bill which starts at 20% and goes to 25%.  That is a little steep, especially given the level of service provided.  Tacky.  \\\\nOverall, we left the restaurant very disappointed.  They will receive excellent reviews because the restaurant itself is beautiful, the owner and chef are very well known throughout the city and it\\'s the new trendy place to go.  Ultimately, they will need to improve the food.  Given that Yelp considers two stars to mean \\\\\"I\\'ve had better\\\\\", that is what they will receive.\"', ' \"Meat lovers, this place is for you. A few doors down from Sister Pie, Marrow is not only a restaurant but also a butcher shop. Ping Ho (the founder) did an amazing job meshing the two together. The interior is modern, chic, yet warm and inviting - I love the posters on the wall in particular. They also have outdoor seating, but it was a bit rainy when I went so we opted to sit inside. The menu is quite unique and is a combination of creating your own charcuterie, small plates and some larger entrees. We tried the Beef Yakitori, House Tartare, Noodles and Broth (they have stuff for vegetarians as well!), and the special which was lamb. For drinks, I had a glass of the Kepos di Ampelela and my friend had the Calypso\\'s Cup. The cocktail was very refreshing and my red was perfect. The standouts for me were definitely the Yakitori (I could\\'ve had 10 more sticks..seriously) and the tartare was delish as well. We finished everything up to the last crumb! I need to come back and try more of the menu. Also, must add that everyone was super nice and sweet and the atmosphere is perfect whether you\\'re on a date or just getting together with friends. P.S. if you want broth to go or some of the other items they serve, they have it available for you to buy!\"', ' \"We live in West Village, been stalking the building for over a year.  Waiting patiently for it to open. On Tuesday we stopped by and were greeted with great enthusfrom the host. We perused the menu and at the first, I thought maybe just drinks because the choices were different ingredients. To my dismay the host confirmed the Caesar salad should be my first choice.  My guy ordered the lamb and we both enjoyed our selection.  It is not the place if you are starving as the portions are European portions, but a nice atmosphere. I definitely will return!\"', ' \"Just delicious. Even as a vegetarian!! The pot au creme was to die for.

Such was our experience at Marrow. Our server was friendly and accommodating. She came over and greeted us right away, and took great pains to explain the menu. Her explanation came with a bit of attempted up-selling, but I\\'m assuming that was part of her training, so I won\\'t hold it against her (much). Decor was nice, but - as we have seen at other trendy restaurants - more could have been done to dampen the ambient noise. As this Yelper\\'s old ears age ever more, we become more sensitive to this issue. It would have been nice to hear the conversation from our co-diner sitting across the table. Next, parking. Nonexistent. No lot, no nearby structure. We managed to snag a spot around the corner on a residential side street. We did worry a bit about the safety of the neighborhood, but all turned out ok. Now, the food.  We went a little crazy with our apps orders, due to the abundance of choices offered on the menu. We got: beet salad (good); charred cauliflower (unexpectedly spicy, server failed to alert us to the large amount of cilantro - problematic for at least 2 of our party); glutinous rice dumplings (very good); toasted marrow (a guilty pleasure - very nice); and Idyll Farms seasonal cheese. This last app (the cheese) was nice. However, it was sliced super- thin, and was served with somewhat fewer crackers than needed - since our server knew we would be sharing the apps, a couple more crackers would not have been too much to ask. And now, the entrees. Our co-diners shared one of the 2 Michigan selections, the ribeye. They seemed to enjoy it.  At $55, one would hope so. Our less expensive selection ($45), the strip, was disappointing. Flavor was fine, but the dish was marred by a tendon running the length of the meat that was impossible to cut through, even with the special steak knives our server made a big deal in presenting to us in a special steak knife box. I struggled so mightily, and with so little success, to cut our steak that the establishment ended up apologizing,removing the steak from our bill, and comping us a couple of desserts. Kudos for the good effort, but sad that it was necessary. Especially in a place that claims to specialize in well-butchered meat. Desserts were: just ok. One was a lemon cornmeal cake with sorbet and blueberries, the other some kind of donut. Not memorable. Can\\'t complain too much, since they were comped. But I don\\'t think I\\'d order them on a future visit. All in all, would rate the service 4 to 5 stars, the apps very nice, but the entree - not great.\"', ' \"This spot hits all the high notes and as the night progresses the highs don\\'t stop.

We would go back in a heartbeat and next time do the meat offered.. don\\'t hesitate to go\"', ' \"Great place. Food. Waitstaff great people watching. Everything on the menu we tried was delicious.  The bar tender mixes a great drink. Try the Manhattan.\"', ' \"Great service, the food was spectacular, the butcher shop was amazing. Overall, a great experience and one of the best meals I have had in Detroit. We will be back!\"', ' \"Marrow hit the ground running. The care put into each detail is everywhere on display, from chic interior to warm and knowledgeable staff, precisely mixed drinks and thoughtful wines by the glass (this is the best/most interesting new wine selection I\\'ve come across in at least a year), delightful and delicious Asian inflections on known and lesser known ingredients and portions of meat. The quality of the non-meat ingredients, from mushrooms to tofu, is exceptional. Our group enjoyed the precision of flavors immensely. \\\\n\\\\nThis still new restaurant is already performing at the level of some of Detroit\\'s best - Selden Standard, Lady of the House, Mabel Grey. Remember to call ahead for a reservation - Marrow is, understandably, packed!\"', ' \"Excellent. The staff is well-cared for and it\\'s very evident with the service/ insights provided. Each dish has a wonderful complexity of flavors, which was a pleasant surprise given the unassuming menu descriptions. This is the next bright spot in Detroit dining.\"', ' \"Beautiful fun new concept with well executed food and a lovely wait and bar staff. What a great addition to the neighborhood!\"', ' \"Chef Sarah does it again! Tonight was proof u can bring a family of meat and potato lovers to an experience light-years from their comfort zone and leave them all sentimenting \\'I have no idea what I just ate but I loved it\\'. Thank you for a very special evening Marrow!\"', ' \"The appetizers we had were good, the service was okay, however, when it came to ordering our main course we were told the only offering was a NY Strip, and that that was the feature of the night. No fillet, no bone in rib eye, only a New York Strip!  We left and went to a real steak house.\"', ' \"Given the name, I was expecting the menu to lean towards steak.  That being said, what we had was delicious and we will definitely be going back!\"', ' \"OK so I know this has been open for several months but WOW! It\\'s new to me. First of all don\\'t WALK....RUN!!! If you haven\\'t tried this restaurant it is a MUST! The atmosphere is amazing, the people are amazing and OH did I mention the food is amazing? I highly recommend if you are a Marrow virgin like we were to go for the tasting menu. Uuuuunnnnbbbbeeellllliiiiieeevvvvaaaabbbbllllleee. We sat at the chefs table which was so much fun. We had the honor to watch all the magic happen. We also had the honor of sitting right next to the sous chef Phoebe, who educated us, guided us and was part of our unbelievable experience.What a beautiful person she is.  As was Stephanie who was our culinary representative (I don\\'t believe a waiter/waitress/server is a great title anymore. A culinary representative is much more descriptive of what they do and know!) and did a fabulous job recommending a yummy cocktail and the tasting menu. She was sweet, made sure we were OK and approached the evening with a big beautiful smile! We watched Annika in the kitchen and Emma too and they were both so sweet and pumped out some amazing food, again with big smiles. We really felt like we were a part of the preparation process. Actually everyone that is a part of this team had smiles on their faces. I told Phoebe this was the most Zen restaurant I have experienced. There was no yelling (in the kitchen) the staff all really respectful of one another, no side eyes and NO ATTITUDES! WOW even if the food wasn\\'t amazing I would go back just to experience the well oiled machine they have going on. OK the FOOD? The FOOD I really can\\'t say enough about the FOOD. Since we did the tasting menu we were able to try so many different dishes. The scallops.....I don\\'t even like scallops and I would have eaten a dozen. (do you order scallops by the dozen? I don\\'t know but I certainly would have! lol) The rice dumplings; so so good, Citrus radish slaw....light, hint of mint, crunch and wonderful. OH...who needs to wait for a cider mill donut? Not me when I can have a slice of kabocha squash dipped in tempura and given a very hot oil bath dolloped with chutney, cheese OK just try it! Last night the meat offering was a lamb kofta! So flavorful with yummy potatoes with a herby mix and a tzatziki sauce. There was more; the food just kept coming! It sadly had to end but not without a bang of sour cream ice cream with a little almond soft cookie/cakey madeline looking piece of deliciousness! Amazing the whole experience. So many restaurants have great food, or great people, or a great ambiance but very few are able to do it all great; Marrow does! I enjoy great food with a friendly team behind it and that is why I loved this experience at Marrow. Thanks you to the Marrow team! You all should be so proud! We will be back!\"', ' \"The beef heart wrapped in beef navel was bomb. It melted in my mouth. I think I even shed a tear as I was eating it. Charcuterie done right as well. I would definitely come back.\"', ' \"Nice little place. Food was pretty good. Nothing that memorable that has me wanting to go back soon. Doesn\\'t mean i wouldn\\'t come back but many other places to try. I wish you could give half stars because i would give it 3.5.\"', ' \"What a rip off! Marrow toast tasted of dill and the raisins and nuts  in the rye bread, but could not actually taste the marrow. Steak tartare was salty, could taste the mushroom but, again, the meat dis not have much flavor. Dry aged NY strip was much of the same: lots of butter but not much taste. It was also the tiniest NY strip I\\'ve ever seen. The scallion pancake that came with it was greasy and rubbery. Never again.\"', ' \"Marrow is incredible! Our server Gabi was very knowledgeable of the menu and explained all of the dishes with some recommendations. The charcuterie was the best i\\'ve ever had, and each meat or cheese came with a jam or vegetable that complemented the flavor. Plus, i\\'m still thinking about the delicious scallops I had. Although the concept is a butcher shop, and the meat is farm to table and soo good, they also have great vegetarian options. I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone and can\\'t wait to go back!\"', ' \"Nice atmosphere, food tasted pretty good. The chef is very hands on!\"', ' \"What a wonderful referral from a client!  The food and service was excellent.  Looking forward to my next visit.\"', ' \"Came here for brunch. Now I understand why this place is packed! Great food. Big Bao is awesome. The pork belly is fantastic. The menu offers a lot more and it is worth coming back to this place. Friendly staff too!\"', ' \"I really wanted to love this place. Meat galore nice interior. But it\\'s mostly bad. It\\'s outside the downtown corridor and part of my problem is that the price should reflect that. We had several items from their charcuterie menu. None were very impressive. The pickled shrimp tasted fishy and was odd. The charcuterie meats are ok at best. Nothing special. Two of us decided to pick our own meats from the butcher. The cuts looked nice. Had the aged flavor. However under seasoned. One was ordered medium and was a cold medium rare. The other was ordered medium rare and was black and blue. To pay high end steak house prices for a non steak house experience and poor cooking is not my idea of a nice meal. Hope things improve for you all. The staff was a pleasure.  Oh and the marrow toast is a hard no. I just assumed i was getting bone marrow and toast as a side to put it on. It\\'s not. Why is it not just that....ughhh\"']\n",
